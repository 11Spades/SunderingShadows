wimpy - manage automatic fleeing

%^CYAN%^SYNOPSIS%^RESET%^

wimpy [on [%^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^PERCENT%^RESET%^]]
wimpy off

%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION%^RESET%^

Wimpy allows you to automatically flee from combat when your hit points are reduced below the % of your total you have specified with the command. Of course, some combat circumstances make it possible to lose more than that % in one shot, so this is not fail safe.

Without an argument, this command will display direction to run to.

To choose where to flee by default use %^ORANGE%^<wimpydir>%^RESET%^ command.

%^CYAN%^SEE ALSO%^RESET%^

wimpydir, flee, kill
