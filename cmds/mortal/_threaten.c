threaten - warn a lower player that they are provoking you to PK

%^CYAN%^SYNOPSIS%^RESET%^

threaten %^ULINE%^%^ORANGE%^PLAYER%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION%^RESET%^

The command will run levelcheck to identify validity of the threat first, then if you're threatening lower player they will recieve a warning that their next action might result in Player Kill.

If %^ULINE%^%^ORANGE%^PLAYER%^RESET%^ continues to provoke you, you're free to engage in Player Kill.

Failure to warn a much lower level character may result in retcon and punishing, depending on the current Player Kill policy.
