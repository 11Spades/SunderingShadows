/* probably combined with possibly someone else (targets) eavesdropping
(Styx) <wiz> Oh, and duration without trying again too?
Someone <wiz> also we should change the command to allow more then one person to eaves drop
*/
/*
Someone <wiz> based on the message type it does some stuff and then calls catch tell

(Styx) <wiz> OK, boiled down to the really basic stuff, I see that.
Someone <wiz> The hard(er) part is where do you intercept it to be the best fit with everything you want to do.
Someone <wiz> because you want the person to his own tranlations I'd say that you intercept and resend immediately

Someone <wiz> you might want to parse out the whisper
Someone <wiz> the Joe whispers to you: and change it to Joe whispers to bob:
Someone <wiz> that would be a cool feature

(Styx) <wiz> I had already decided the whisper thing needed to send the prefix separate from the message.

Someone <wiz> make it so that cap names get translated to you if ...
Someone <wiz> Look at how say is parsed.
Someone <wiz> It finds the colon, then translates past the colon.
(Styx) <wiz> OK, let's see if I have the right general idea of how this would work for the eavesdrop to use receive_message?

(Styx) <wiz> We would add something into the whisper part that would check for an eavesdropper property and include the eavesdropping person/object/whatever in the list of who receives that message?
Someone <wiz> Right

(Styx) <wiz> OK, and then we'd need the code to send it what we wanted it to get versus what the normal recipient gets?
~styx/bin  Someone <wiz> So you could call find_player("grendel")->subscribe_message("say",TP) and it would send his says to you to be processed, however that's going to work.

(Styx) <wiz> And that's where he was saying it would be cool if the code could use one tell_object or whatever and substitute name for you?
~styx/bin  Someone <wiz> right
Someone <wiz> You break the whisper at the colon, then take the 'you' and parse it to '$$&&$$name$$&&$$
--------------
(Garrett) replies: No, I was thinking what if you wanted to send the subscribed messages to a different function rather than receive_message.

You reply to (Garrett): Is there a subscribe message thing too?
You reply to (Garrett): Or that's what you're calling the list of people who get a given one?
~styx/bin  (Garrett) replies: No, i was giving that as an example of what the new function in user might be called.

You reply to (Garrett): I did remember why I was poking around in it before btw.  It was cleaning up the color/resets on the in/out messages or something.
You reply to (Garrett): I figured out enough to fix some of it, but I remember some of it not cooperating too because of the way that function was laid out or something.
~styx/bin  (Garrett) replies: If you pass it as a string you can use the function form
of call_other(object ob, ({ string function, string argument }) )

(Garrett) replies: And the messages thing, you might have wanted to go lower and check out /std/user/env.c or something there.

This command lets you attempt to discern the whispers of another person. It is a combination, depending on circumstances and your skill, of lipreading and/or managing to get in a position to overhear the whispers.

Success of this command depends on your and target's perception skill.

Without an argument, you will stop listening to other conversations.
