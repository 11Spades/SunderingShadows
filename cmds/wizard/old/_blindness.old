@HELP
Blindness (Illusion/Phantasm)
-----------------------------
Usage: cast blindness on <target>

Range: same room as caster
Casting time: 2 rds.
Visual Component only.
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

	The "blind" spell causes the target to lose all sight for the 
duration of the spell.  More importantly, because of that, the target
recieves a -6 to all attack rolls and is unable to retaliate against
attackers for the spell duration.  The blindness will also effect
how a player sees his inventory, the room, etc. as if it were totally
dark.
