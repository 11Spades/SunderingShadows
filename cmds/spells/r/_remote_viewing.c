"crystal ball used must be of finely polished crystal of a minimum cost of 1,000 gp - such ones are generally found only "
"in psion enclaves as they are both large and fragile, making them impossible to carry around.\n\nYou will not be able "
"to scry a character that you have not recognized previously with the 'recognize' command.  Your chance of success in "
"using the crystal ball on a character is less if you recognize someone as something other than their true name, but its "
"better than nothing.  You may not scry locations at all unless they are in memory via the remember command.\n\nThere is "
"also a chance that the target of the power may notice that they are being scryed.  This depends on their class, and is "
"adjusted significantly by intelligence, and operates independently of any scry detection magic or devices.");
