Syntax: slay <target>
Effect: Causes the target to die. Target must be alive, in the room with
        you and not a player or immortal.
       
        This is intended for use in plots and stuff when you need
        something to just keel over dead. Feel free to use your own
        echoes or whatever to explain the death.
