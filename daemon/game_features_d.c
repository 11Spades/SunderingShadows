An upcoming game features daemon. 

GAME_FEATURES = (["Feature Name" : (["Feature Name" : "blah", "Feature Description" : "blah blah blah", "Voting Expires In" : time (-1 for never), 
                                  "Feature Author" : "saide", "Name Votes" : ({}), "IP Votes" : ({}), "Account Votes" : ({}), "ETA" : "date", time, "TBA?",

feature command theory
    (immortal only) feature add Name, Description, Expires, ETA. 
    feature vote name | yes or no (records IP, name, account - 1 per)
    feature 
        lists feature name / author / ETA / Yes Votes / No Votes / when voting expires  
    feature view name 
        lists feature description
    feature remove name 
        LAW access or feature author only - removes a feature prematurely - if feature author - send notification to players who are online and have opted
        in to be notified. 
    feature notifications | on or off
        on (default) turns on feature notifications if you have not voted / or when voting expires
        off turns off feature notifications entirely.
