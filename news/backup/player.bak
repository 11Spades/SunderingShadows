		%^BOLD%^WELCOME TO SHADOWGATE%^RESET%^

	We are now open for beta testing. I would like to thank all of you
who have volunteered to help us through this stage. I would also like to 
thank all those who have helped us get to this point. I would also like to
thank our current sys. admin. Firedragon.

	Now as beta testers there are certain things that you must understand.
This mud still has major bugs. Some we know of and are working to finish.
Others are unknown to us. Please if you find any bugs or are alerted to an 
error tell an online wiz or mail arch. Also we have several areas open, by the
time we open the mud completely many more areas will be operating. Please 
have patience with administration we will deal with bugs as quickly as possible.
This mud does provide many challenges and should provide you with a lot of fun
while you search out our bugs... 
	Also if something seems unbalanced or unfair about your class or race
please alert us. Balance is of the utmost concern to us.

Thank you all very much.
	Shadowgate is open for beta testing!!!!
