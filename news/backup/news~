Hello all.. The e-mail from people who aren't going to be back has made the
mail system TOO LARGE for it's own good, and a couple people have had email
errors.. So We wiped the mail database out in hopes it would fix a lot of
errors.. If you REALLY need some messages.. Contact Me <FIREDRAGON> and I
may be able to salvage one or two.. (P.S> Relize.. it's VERRY HARD to get
them back.. so make shure you REALLY need them. Thanks...
