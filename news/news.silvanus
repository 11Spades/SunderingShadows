%^GREEN%^The realms are abuzz with news from Laerad.  The fearsome creature that has been sighted for months now has been identified as the dread %^RED%^tarrasque%^GREEN%^, a creature of legend.  Asgard has been razed to the ground, and even Parnelli forest has been been affected.  The citizens of Asgard have scattered and can be found in various churches, healers, temples, and inns from Azha to Torm.  Local authorities are asking for help in the form of supplies, coin, and comfort for the injured, the orphaned, and the homeless.  

%^CYAN%^Rumor has it that a brave band of adventurers journeyed to Laerad to fight the foul beast.  With the aid of a %^GREEN%^druid circle%^CYAN%^ and no small amount of heart and skill, they were able to send the creature back into its hibernation - though whether for one year or one thousand, it is impossible to say.  As the beast slid back into its slumber, the leader of the druid circle took to the sky, revealing himself to be none other than %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Silvanus%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^, the %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^O%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^a%^BOLD%^k %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^F%^ORANGE%^a%^GREEN%^t%^BOLD%^h%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^er%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^!

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^While a sort of peace has fallen over Laerad, many questions remain.  Will Asgard be rebuilt?  Who will help the citizens - and who will try to capitalize on their misfortune?  What will the return of Silvanus mean to the realms?  And just what role will the sudden influx of druids play?
