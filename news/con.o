NOTES:

Hit Point adj:  is added to, or subracted from *each* hit die rolled for 
the character.  However, no hit die ever yields less than 1 hp, 
regardless of modifications.  If an adjustment would lower the number 
rolled to 0 or less, consider the final result to be 1.  Always use the 
characters current constitution to determine hit point bonuses and 
penalties.  Only warriors are entitled to a constitution bonus of +3 or 
+4.  Non warrior characters who have constitution scores of 17 or 18 
recieve only +2 per die.  The constitution bonus ends when a character 
reaches 10th level (9th for warriors and priests) - neither the 
constitution bonus, nor hit dice are added to a characters hit points 
after he has passed this level.  If a characters constitution changes 
during the course of adventuring, his hit points may be adjusted up or 
down to reflect the change.  The difference between the characters 
current hit point bonus (if any) and the new bonus is multiplied by the 
characters level (up to 10) and added to/or subracted from the characters 
total.

System Shock:  States the percentage chance a character has to survive 
magical affects that reshape or age his body:  petrification (and 
reversing petrification), polymorph, magical aging, etc.  It can also be 
used to see if the character retains consciousness in particularly 
difficult situations for example if the character loses more than half 
his *original* hit points in one blow.

poison save:  modifies the saving throw for poison for humans, elves, 
gnomes, and half-elves.  dwarves and halflings do not use this 
adjustment, since they have special resistances to poison attacks.

regeneration:  enable those with specially endowed constitutions (perhaps 
by a wish or magical item) to heal at an advanced rate, regenerating 
damage taken.  The character heals 1 point of damage after the passage of 
the listed number of turns.
