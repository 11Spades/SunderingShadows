Notes:

Reaction Adj:  Modifies the die roll to see if a character is surprised 
when he unexpectedly encounters NPC's.  The more positive the modifier, 
the less likely the character is to be surprised.

Missile Attack Adj:  Is used to modify a characters to-hit die roll 
whenever he uses a missile weapon (a bow or a thrown weapon).  A positive 
number makes it easier for the character to hit with a missile, while a 
negative number makes it harder.

Defense adj:  Applies to a characters saving throws against attacks that 
can be dodged - lightning bolts, boulders, etc.  It also modifies the 
characters armor class, representing his ability to dodge normal missiles 
and parry weapon thrusts.  For example, Wrath is wearing chainmail, 
giving him an armor class of 5.  If his dexterity score is 16, his armor 
class is modified by -2 to 3, making him harder to hit.  If his dexterity 
score is 5, his armor class is modified by +2 to 7, making him easier to hit.
