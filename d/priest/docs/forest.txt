Hi Svaha (this time),

Here something about the forest :

--

As you walk on a path wandering the flatlands you see a great green forest
in a distance. You can't see the horizon 'cause this majestic forest covers
all of it. When you come nearer you see and here all the sounds, sights 
and smells of a huge forest. 

You enter this forest on a wide but meandering path. When you walk the 
path you notice the serenity of this mighty forest. You see little 
animals and you believe that pixies and other creatures of nature dwell here.

In a distance to the west you can see a vast open space within the forest. 
The bushes and the other growth block your sight on it that you can only 
see the outline of that open space.

You see footsteps leading in that direction, so you believe that it is of
some and maybe great importance. to the east the forest darkens and you 
think that greater powers live in that part of the forest.

You still see lots of animals who live and play here but the vast numbers
of them inhibit you to get a good fix on their numbers.

When you wander westwards you enter a vast open space with in the middle
a huge circle of rocks. You sence that this is the central circle of the
Druids. You sence the neutrality and the alignment with nature in this place.

When you wander north the forest darkens. The darker forces of nature dwell
here. You'll find trolls and gnolls there and you suspect that deep inside
the forest high up in the black hills there is a dragonslayer. Only the
more dareing will go there and try to withstand these perils of danger.

To the east a huge bushland seems to go on forever. It seems an ideal place
for criminals and bandits to hide out. You see several little peasant 
settlements here where a few farmers can survive thanx to the blessing of
all the dieties.

I hope you can use this !
