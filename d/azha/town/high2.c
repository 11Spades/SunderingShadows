	You are walking on High Street, west of the center of town.  To the
south of you, you notice a high, crenellated stone wall that seems to
be surrounding something in the center of the city, probably the
trade market. To the north, you see the sides of a few buildings, but
no doors.  High Street continues to the east and west.
