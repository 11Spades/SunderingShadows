	You are walking on High Street, near the West Gate of the town. You
can see lines of wagons that have recently been let into the town
making their way along the street towards the center of the city,
probably towards the markets.  Citizens, soldiers and travellers make
this area very congested.  You also notice that there is a street that
intersects this one, going north-south along the west wall.  High
Street continues to the east.
