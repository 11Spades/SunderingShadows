Concerning advancing...

1.) Woo woo!  I found some monsters and crushed a few skulls!  Now my experience needed to advance in the <%^BOLD%^score%^RESET%^> command list is in the negatives?!?  Am I bugged or do I have to do something to advance in levels?

No you are not bugged.  Yes you must do something to advance.  You go to any room with a posting board present, church or dock and type <%^BOLD%^advance%^RESET%^>. If you have gained the proper experience required you will then receive your advancement of level. You continue to gain experience and it will carry over if you don't advance right away.  

Every ten levels you will be asked if you wish to add a class. If you decide to do so, follow the prompts, and you will begin a new life as a multi-classed player!
