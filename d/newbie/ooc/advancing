22) Woo woo!  I found some monsters and crushed a few skulls!  Now
    though my experience needed to advance in the <score> command list
    is in the negatives?!?  Am I bugged or do I have to do something
    to advance in levels?

No your not bugged.  Yes you must do something to advance.  You go to any guild hall, class guild hall, room with a posting board present, the forkroad of shadow, any city center and type : advance. If you have gained the proper experience required and you have enough gold to pay for the cost of training your character on you, you will then
receive your advancement of level.

You continue to gain experience and it will carry over if you don't advance right away.  Also, every five levels you will have to find a special trainer in order to advance.  Typing '%^BOLD%^help advance%^RESET%^' will always tell you how much it will cost to advance and when you are 5th, 10th, etc. level it will give you a hint where you will find the trainer you need to advance next.  Signposts you may notice as you wander around mark their locations.

For those of you who are multiclassed, you can also <advance class> to advance one of your classes without using the <pose> command to change which class you are acting as.

25) I've heard of someone being called a High Mortal? What's that?

A High Mortal is someone who has achieved a level of fame beyond ordinary mortals and is either well known for his or her deeds throughout the land, or has his or her name spoken in hushed tones, hopefully not to garner too much attention.  It is a level of status and it may be granted by any immortal who feels you meet the requirements.  The requirements and benefits are listed under <help highmortal>.
