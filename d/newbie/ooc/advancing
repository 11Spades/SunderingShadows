Concerning advancing...

1.) Woo woo!  I found some monsters and crushed a few skulls!  Now my experience needed to advance in the <%^BOLD%^score%^RESET%^> command list is in the negatives?!?  Am I bugged or do I have to do something to advance in levels?

No you are not bugged.  Yes you must do something to advance.  You go to any room with a posting board present, church or dock and type <%^BOLD%^advance%^RESET%^>. If you have gained the proper experience required you will then receive your advancement of level.

You continue to gain experience and it will carry over if you don't advance right away.  Also, every five levels you will have to find a special trainer in order to advance.  Typing <%^BOLD%^help advance> %^RESET%^will give you a hint where you will find the trainer you need to advance next.  You, and only you, will notice a sign post marking where your trainer is camped in the rumored area. If you are struggling to find your trainer, let an imm know. We are here to help.

Every ten levels you will be asked if you wish to add a class. If you decide to do so, follow the prompts, and you will begin a new life as a multi-classed player!

You will need to seek out a special quest-giver and complete their task to advance from the 19th to the 20th level.
