Concerning stats...

1.) How do I know my stats?

The commands <%^BOLD%^score%^RESET%^> and <%^BOLD%^stats%^RESET%^> are available for your reference.

2.) What do the stats mean?

Stats are numerical representations of your basic physical make-up, which is is determined when you first create your character. These stats are used in different relevant aspects of your mud life.

Constitution determines how sturdy you are, which in basic terms, means it determines how healthy you are. A higher constitution will mean you gain extra hit points when you advance levels.

Intelligence determines your capacity for using magic, namely, how successful the spell casting of certain classes will be. If you are not a spell caster then intelligence has less of a bearing on your mud life.

Dexterity factors into many different situations. It determines your ability to avoid blows, as well as affecting your athletic, stealth and thieving skills. Additionally, a high dexterity provides a bonus to your armour class (AC) rating.

Strength alone determines naturally how much you are able to carry. It also, if high enough, will provide you with a bonus "to hit" when in combat, and will cause your blows to deal extra damage on top of the regular amount you normally would do.

Wisdom determines your resistance to offensive magic, as well as affects your perception skill. It is also adds to certain magical ability and spell casting. Clerics, paladins, and druids all will find a high wisdom extremely helpful.

Charisma factors into your ability to get by normally aggressive monsters and in the buying and selling of goods. It also helps to define your character's looks and personality. The higher the charisma, the charismatic your character should be. This could be in the way of appearance, influence, or reputation. Sorcerers, Bards and Warlocks base their casting power on charisma.

You will find your experience on Sundering Shadows much better if you try to avoid dealing with the numbers and let the MUD handle most of these for you. This is not to say, however, that you will be able to get away with portraying yourself as a beauty queen with the sweetest personality with a Charisma score of 8.

3.) How do I raise my stats?

Every few levels, you will receive a point that can be applied to any stat you choose. Each stat can be raised to a base number of 25. Certain spells and equipment can affect your stats as well, but no stat can reach beyond 30. Please note that age and race can affect your stats.
