Bugs and features are a common source of problems. Bugs fall into two major catagories, things that are broken, (true bugs) or features that interact with other features in an unrealized or unforeseen manner. Some MUDs spend (literally) years testing and retesting areas, functionality etc, trying to track down the bugs. We on ShadowGate feel that we serve the MUD better by doing the  basic testing and play testing, and then allowing the populace to play in the area. We improve the MUD at a greater rate and we can let the player base help us shape things as we go more effectively. This, however, can create situations where things are broken, both for the benefit and detriment of the player. This will also introduce functionality that may conflict with other functionality. We expect players to always report these situations. Please read <%^BOLD%^help game%^RESET%^> for more information.
      
Exploiting bugs is illegal. If you think you are getting something too easily, then you probably are and it is most likely a bug. If you are not sure, ask a wiz. If you are caught exploiting a bug, you will be jailed and whatever you have gained illegally will be taken away. If you continue, you will be rid.
