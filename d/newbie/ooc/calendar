%^BOLD%^BLUE%^> The SG Calendar <%^RESET%^
Time in the realms of ShadowGate is divided in the following way:
   20 seconds in one minute             6 days in one week
   60 minutes in one hour               4 weeks in one month
   20 hours in one day                 10 months in one year

(This comes out to 3.6 SG days passing in one RL day.)
   
The days of the week are named after the process of the creation of the realms:
   Shadowday - all the universe was empty darkness
   Formday - the land itself was given shape 
   Waterday - the land's thirst was quenched by the first drop of water 
   Flameday - the land's cold was warmed by the first spark of heat
   Lightday - the land's darkness was touched by the first ray of the sun 
   Lifeday - the land's creatures were first given breath and life
   
The months of the year are named for the seasons and activities of the realms:
   Winterstime
   Renewal
   Springstime
   Plantingdays 
   Sundays
   Summerstime
   Growingdays
   Harvestdays
   Autumnstime
   Colddays
