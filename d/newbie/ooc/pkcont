Concerning (not) killing another player...

Currently all pkill situations are defined as any combat that has a player or a player controlled being (spell, monster, etc) in it. When a player's hp falls below zero in a pkill situation, the player will fall unconscious.  This will be relayed as being "at death's door".

This concept is close but not the same as the death's door in D&D. Players will gradually heal, based on constitution, or you may <%^BOLD%^feed vial to playername%^RESET%^>. Be warned that hostile monsters may very well see you unconscious and deal you a death blow. 

If you wish to finish a player off, use the <%^BOLD%^hit%^RESET%^> command. If a player is not bound or unconscious this will simply start combat. Now what else can one do to a unconscious player? 

A player with rope can <%^BOLD%^bind%^RESET%^> an unconscious player. Binding will trap a player for an extended period of time. Nice players can of course <%^BOLD%^unbind%^RESET%^> bound players. Bound players can <%^BOLD%^struggle%^RESET%^> in an attempt to free themselves. The rope use skill aids both the act of binding, and struggling. You can also <%^BOLD%^blindfold%^RESET%^> and <%^BOLD%^gag%^RESET%^> a bound player.

Bound players can be dragged. You need to be able to lift a lot of the players weight. If you are capable, you can <%^BOLD%^drag%^RESET%^> the bound player with you. At any time you can <%^BOLD%^drop%^RESET%^> the player. Of course all good muggers will <%^BOLD%^strip%^RESET%^> the body of the victim.  Torture, kidnapping, imprisonment (and jail breaks), public hangings and executions, and blackmail are just a few suggestions of what to do with your victim.

Please note, quitting is not an IC command. If you quit out of any of these situations as a means of escape you will find that it will not work the way you plan it. You will also be penalized heavily.
