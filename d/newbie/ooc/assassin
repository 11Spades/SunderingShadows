Assassins are no longer simply a specialization for thieves.  Most can add assassin to their existing class if they dare risk , via a quest that must be found and completed.  It adds the cumulative experience requirements for the additional class at the time the quest is completed.  However, killing people in cold blood simply for money is strictly an evil act so only evil characters can become assassins and of course if they have the stats (all the requirements are secret, however).

Additional abilities for assassins, besides a (secret of course) network for personal bounties to be collected for money are:

   critical attack -> crit <target>  (does extra damage of course, based on concepts similar to the fighter rush and thief stab)

   weapon poisoning -> poison <weapon> (must have poison to do this)
