COMMUNICATION with OTHERS as a CHARACTER (IC) and as a PLAYER (OOC)

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Languages %^RESET%^- Type '%^BOLD%^languages%^RESET%^' to see the ones you were given in creation based on your race and intelligence and to see how well you know each.  Most likely you only speak one at 100(%) and will need lessons to improve the others.  Those with enough intelligence can %^BOLD%^<teach> %^RESET%^a language they know well enough.

In the meantime, you will have to use emotes (think sign language or charades) to communicate with others who don't speak your language well, or try repeating short phrases if they seem to understand you a little.  You will be speaking common at first even if you don't know it, so <say blah> may come out as gibberish if that's not your native language.  You may want to %^BOLD%^<speak languagename> %^RESET%^to change the language you're speaking to the one you know best.

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Lines are OOC (out of character).  %^RESET%^Use the newbie line to ask most of your questions that can't be resolved IC (in character) - type 'newbie I have a question about...' etc.  High mortals %^BOLD%^(help highmortal) %^RESET%^also have this line to help answer questions.  Typing '%^BOLD%^lines%^RESET%^' will show you all the lines you have access to.  A 'Someone' on a line is a wiz or an avatar and should be listened to accordingly.  Be SURE to read %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^<help line use> %^RESET%^.  Lines and emotes are priviledges that can and will be removed for a period of time or permanently if they are abused.

Try to think like an adventurer and don't use the lines as a crutch.  You are expected to explore and find things on your own.  Lines are for help with syntax, game mechanics, etc.  However, we do encourage forming a party (%^BOLD%^help party%^RESET%^) of compatible characters to adventure, so you can use lines to ask for people to join you to adventure somewhere and arrange a meeting place.
