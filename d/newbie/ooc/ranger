Although having the basic skills of a warrior, the ranger has other advantages.  They will begin earning clerical spells from their god at level 8 (but only up to third level spells).  A ranger can also dual wield and %^BOLD%^<handle> %^RESET%^horses to gain their loyalty.

Dual Wielding is the skill of wielding two weapons both normal for their size without any penalties.  A ranger of the large races can wield two large weapons, whereas a human-size ranger can wield two medium weapons.  To be able to Dual Wield, the ranger cannot wear any types of armor heavier than studded leather, as anything heavier would be too difficult to manuever effectively in.  They can, however, wear bracers for additional protection when wearing the lighter armor.  Wearing armor heavier than studded, they can still use one weapon of normal size for them and one smaller.

When dual wielding, its harder to carry things, both hands are full. This is where the 15% increase in encumbrance occurs.  (Seems a little complicated but is actually logical.)  Everyone can only carry a certain amount of things, Rangers, while they Dual Wield cannot obviously carry as much. Therefore, however much weight the ranger carries, an extra 15% is added to load. This 15% does not have any bearing on a rangers stamina.  If a ranger is carrying TOO MUCH, then they are over-encumbered, so logically they cannot Dual Wield.

%^BOLD%^BOWS...%^RESET%^

Rangers are still warriors, woodland warriors to be more specific, and all
rangers have the potential for superior skill and knowledge with the bow.  All rangers %^BOLD%^specialize %^RESET%^with bows.  This means they can place more than the usual proficiencies into the bow they choose to use.  The benefits of a higher proficiency include more damage per shot and more shots per round.  For more details see <help specialization>.

GODS!!!

Rangers are warriors who are very in touch with nature, they also are champions of a specific god.  All rangers choose to serve a particular diety and in turn the diety will grant them up to third level spells (refer to poster on clerics about spells).  A god's influence in a ranger's life is very important and should be roleplayed according to that god.
