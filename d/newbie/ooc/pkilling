8) Is player killing allowed?
 
Yes.  Players who are still newbies are protected in rule form (no longer by coding) from non-newbies.  There is NO protection of any sort from fellow newbies.  If you are still a newbie, it is important that you do not provoke non-newbies, including looting their corpses or even verbal antagonism  unless you are ready to accept the consequences.  Any offensive actions toward non-newbies revokes the rule keeping them from harming you.  Continued provocation of non-newbies visiting you in this area is likely to get your newbie status removed.
