Concerning the killing of other players...

1.) Is player killing allowed?

Playerkilling on ShadowGate is optional. All players are, by default, but to the exclusion of beast races, opted out of playerkilling. You can change this by typing <%^BOLD%^flag player kill . off%^RESET%^>. It should be noted that there are certain circumstances which will temporarily flag you for non-pk again, such as a recent death or an extended absence. If you are not currently available to pk, you should avoid situations where the roleplay might turn aggressive. Additionally, you are only able to engage in pk with players who have a %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^K%^RESET%^ next to their names on the wholist. If pk happens, we would appreciate it if you could send a <%^BOLD%^pkmail%^RESET%^> so we can better understand the circumstances that led to it, and if any consequences are warranted. Please see <%^BOLD%^help pkmail%^RESET%^> for more information.
