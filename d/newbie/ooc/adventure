=========================================================================
Buy a map of the town from the scribe, or simply make your own as you go.  You will want to map as you adventure so you can find your way out of places or back to town when you get hungry and thirsty or need to sell things, etc.  You can %^BOLD%^<peer direction>%^RESET%^ to try to see what is ahead, especially the obvious exits.  Indoors, until you are high mortal, you can only peer one room and need to use %^BOLD%^<peer north 1>%^RESET%^, etc.  Outdoors you will see up to 10 or so rooms ahead or, if you only want to see the next five, you can <peer west 5>.

Before you leave the city in search of adventure, you'll want to train in your weapon of choice.  Type '%^BOLD%^profs%^RESET%^' now to see what it is and how many proficiencies you have to apply to learning weapons to start out.  Type '%^BOLD%^help profs%^RESET%^' to read how weapon proficiencies work.  After training with the trainer, Mortius, or other combat, you'll need to %^BOLD%^<heal> %^RESET%^yourself or others until you can afford to buy healing kits or have cleric around to cast healing spells.

Mages, clerics, and bards will want to read about spells in the 'classes' room to learn how to use them.  Rangers and paladins receive clerical spells at higher levels so they will want to learn about those eventually also.  All classes have some special skills you'll need to read about in the help files and/or the '%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^classes%^RESET%^' room.

It is acceptable to leave a room (if something isn't keeping you there) to heal, study, pray, or simply try to run away from something.  Reminder - it is illegal  to quit out of a combat situation, however.

You should look at everything you can in each room.  Often descriptions will give you hints on things you can do.  If there is a sign described for instance, you may want to %^BOLD%^<look sign> or <read sign>%^RESET%^.  There may be more to see about anything in the room, even walls or the ceiling.  Sometimes you might even have to specify which of something, such as %^BOLD%^<look west wall>%^RESET%^.

You will also want to try to search many things or do other actions to them.  Examples include %^BOLD%^search room, search pile, or search floor%^RESET%^ or actions such as %^BOLD%^move boulder, lift lever, climb rope%^RESET%^.  Sometimes a thesaurus is handy to look up other words that might work for the actions since the right word won't always be obvious.
