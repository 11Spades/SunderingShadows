Concerning questing...

1.) How many quests do I have to do?
 
Unlike many muds, within Shadowgate all quests are entirely optional.
You do not have to do quests to advance in levels, with one major
exception.  There is a quest (Quest for the Swords) that is required
to be completed by a level 19 player in order to advance to level 20.
Other than that, quests will grant a reward of ability, xp, items,
treasure, etc., for being completed and generally are something worth
solving if you can or so desire.
