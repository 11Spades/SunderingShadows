5) How many quests do I have to do?
 
Unlike many muds, within Shadowgate all quests are entirely optional.
You do not have to do quests to advance in levels, with one major
exception.  There is a quest (Quest for the Swords) that is required
to be completed by a level 19 player in order to advance to level 20.
Other than that, quests will grant a reward of ability, xp, items,
treasure, etc for being completed and generally are something worth
solving if you can or so desire.

There are no quests that you need to join your class with the
notable exception of cavaliers becoming paladins or antipaladins,
although finding your class hall can be considered a quest and a
rite of passage, so asking other people where it is located, is a
bit impolite, at least.
