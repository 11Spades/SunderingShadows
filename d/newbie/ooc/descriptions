%^YELLOW%^ADJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTIONS - A reprint of a helpful post by THORN%^RESET%^
Please review your adjective and description in light of this information several times before you decide you are ready to move into the larger world of Shadowgate.  It is difficult to be sure you are using descriptive words rather than telling people how they should react.  Thorn made the following post a few weeks after adjectives were implemented to help make the difference in word choice clearer for everyone.  Hopefully if you read it more than once and use a thesaurus you can come up with an  appropriate and well-developed description and adjective.  

As posted by Thorn:
Please keep in mind that a description and adjectives are a means by which you describe your *physical* appearance to people.  Stick to the facts, and do not add opinions.  If you were to walk up to me in the street, you would not be able to tell if I was strong or evil or good.  In fact, some people may think I look evil, and some may think I look like a frat boy, depending on your situation (I have never belonged to a fraternity).  If you want people to come to a conclusion about you, you
need to describe things about yourself factually.  If you want to look evil, then perhaps you should say "a sneering drow", if you want to look noble, then "a tall, clean-cut elf".

In addition, some people mix up opinions with facts.  You can be a "muscular dwarf" character, but don't try and tell a firbolg that he should consider you "strong". To him, you're nothing special.  The same thing with beauty.  Sure, you may be the hottest elf maiden since Galadriel, but a lot of dwarves like their women short, stocky and occasionally with some facial hair.  Make sure and think like a character would, not as you, the human player.

Next, descriptions are not your history.  I admit there is a bit of a double standard in that monsters often include lots of history in their descriptions, but really, there is no way yet to get lore on a monster other than a description. For you the player, however, there are backgrounds that you can research.  Players can also fill you in on details.  Monsters (except for NPC's) are not very forthcoming with
information.  Moreover, you should not assume that you're character knows that s/he is being looked at. Certainly in your life, you have looked over someone fairly well without them knowing. Descriptions like "Blah is an elf maiden with brown hair and eyes, suddenly she turns and sees you.  She sees straight into your soul." O-kay.  Admittedly, this is a fantasy world, but puhlease.  Again, this person is trying to tell everyone who looks at them what they are supposed to think.  Thats' poor RP.  Act and leave the judgements to the others.  You can portray yourself as hot, scary, kind, wise without coming out and saying it.  True, it can be misinterpreted, but
that's the point.  We don't walk around with little thought bubbles above our head that say, "25 s/w/m, likes dogs and long strolls on the beach.  Would like family.  Kills orcs for fun." You shouldn't try to make that the case here. 

Lets dissect a small example -
A blonde dwarf is a stocky, muscular dwarf from far to the north.  His demeanor is jolly and and he likes a good fight, but he stands ready to help any in need.

Okay.  Extremely poor.  Why?  This description has three lines, but that's not the issue.  The issue is that 3/4th of this is talking about either the mood of the character or where he is from.  How would anyone know where this dwarf is from?  How would a human be able to gauge the mood of a dwarf?  This player is trying to give you a background, not a description.  You CAN try and hint that you are from a certain place, but you have to build it up properly.

Lets try this:
A blond dwarf is a stocky, muscular dwarf who wears the crest of Kinaro, a city far to the north.  His clothing is made up of rough and well worn cloth and leather.  He wears a set of dented plate armor that despite the obvious punishment it has taken, appears well oiled and well mended.  A dwarven battleaxe hangs from a leather strap at his waist.  Looking at his leathery face, you see that it is creased with laugh lines as well as scars, giving him a somewhat jolly appearance.

As I have said to one person, you are your description.  If you put care into it, players and immorts are going to know that you are involved in the game.  If not, then you'll fight an uphill battle for respect here, and if you fall afoul of the law here, we'll not be as inclined to show you mercy as we would someone who is obviously giving it their best shot and tries his/her best to care about the details.
