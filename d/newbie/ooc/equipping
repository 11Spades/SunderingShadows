You have some starting money, so visit the shops in town.  You'll likely need a lantern or torch sooner or later, even if you have infravision to see in the dark, and a few other things from the general store.  The shopkeepers will respond to many questions you may have, so try talking to them to find out what is suitable.  They are meant to help you have a feeling of roleplay as well as be helpful even when no other players are in the area to interract with.  The armor shop in Offestry will have basics for different sized races. Be sure to ask the shopkeeper to show you the armor you are thinking of buying, so that you can check whether it will fit you.

You will probably want some basic clothing, etc. for RP purposes even though they don't provide protection.  What you are
carrying will save when you quit, except for food and drinks.  (Note - Do not put something in a sack, pouch, etc. and then put that inside another sack or container type item.  Items can only save one level down in container items.  One notable exception is mage component bags, which CAN be put inside something else and retain their contents.

You may also want to open an account at the bank and put a little of your starting gold away in case you get robbed or have your pocket picked.  As soon as you can afford them, you'll want to buy healing kits to carry along.  Even clerics will find there will be times they will need or want them.

NOTE - Do not put a NON-EMPTY container into another container - This will bug whenever your inventory is loaded the next time you log back on.
