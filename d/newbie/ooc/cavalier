A cavalier must be of proper social class, and is usually of noble or aristocratic origin.  A cavalier must always place honor, bravery, and personal deeds in the forefront of his or her activity, and must adhere to a code of conduct and ethics.  A cavalier must serve someone or some cause - normally a deity, greater noble, order of knighthood, or the like.   

Upon being sworn to knighthood, a cavalier must pledge himself or herself to this code.  Failure to sustain the oath is sufficient reason to revoke knighthood, according to the lords of the realm.  Should this happen, the cavalier becomes a mere fighter.

Cavaliers get the following commands to help them in their deeds:
   %^BOLD%^<charge> %^RESET%^- To charge you much be riding a horse and wielding a lance.  %^BOLD%^charge <target> %^RESET%^ i.e. %^YELLOW%^charge goblin %^RESET%^, and then you can enter directions to go through exits to get to the target.

   %^BOLD%^<parry>  %^RESET%^- Puts you in a defensive stance, preparing for any and all attacks that may come, the same command fighters have.

Another characteristic of cavaliers is the ability to train a warhorse.  As a cavalier grows in power, so will his steed.  Simply buy the horse in your guild hall, which you'll have to find by exploring once you leave the Newbie area.  (Currently war horses are not available in the Newbie area.)  Be warned, though, that your warhorse will share in your experience should it be used for attack.  For more information type <help horses>.

**NOTE** Cavaliers are expected to follow the guidelines in <help knights>.
**ALSO** If a cavalier desires to become a paladin or antipaladin, they must undergo an apprenticeship of sorts as detailed in <help squire>.

         Once dedicated to a diety and becoming a paladin or anti-paladin, they must also faithfully serve their god's charges as long as it doesn't conflict with their code of honor or cause them to act below their station.  Knights are a very difficult class to RP properly and are often targets for pk if played well.
