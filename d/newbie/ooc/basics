%^BOLD%^* BASICS OF SURVIVAL *%^RESET%^

You've already figured out how to move from room to room.  Sometimes, however, the exits will be hidden or you'll have to open doors, pay a fee, etc.  You'll need to %^BOLD%^<look> %^RESET%^at things in the room or room description and possibly experiment to figure out what to do.  You will also want to try to %^BOLD%^<search> %^RESET%^things. 

Soon, you'll need to find food to eat %^BOLD%^<eat food> %^RESET%^and drinks to quench your thirst %^BOLD%^<drink drink> %^RESET%^so you don't die of starvation or thirst.  You can buy food and drinks at Bars or Inns, usually found in towns such as Offestry.  Outdoors, you can try to %^BOLD%^<hunt>  %^RESET%^for food.  You can sometimes %^BOLD%^<drink> %^RESET%^from a pond or fountain.  As with everything, sometimes there will be hints in the room or you may have to simply experiment to get the correct syntax.

So, you'll want to find your way around Offestry, buy some food and drink and shop for gear. If you decide to open an account at a bank, please withdrawl your money before leaving the area.  When at the stores, %^BOLD%^<help shop> %^RESET%^will usually bring up a help file for the commands the shop uses.  The shopkeepers and NPCs, especially in Offestry, will respond to many questions and will also randomly mention things that will be helpful to you.
