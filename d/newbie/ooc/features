As a newbie you can %^BOLD%^<bury> %^RESET%^a corpse from a kill, which will heal you some, or use %^BOLD%^<offerall> %^RESET%^to clear all the corpses and leave the items and coins they were carrying so you can pick them up.  You can also %^BOLD%^<offer item> %^RESET%^or %^BOLD%^<offer item to godname> %^RESET%^if you don't want to cart it to town to sell it and that will often heal you of hp.  %^YELLOW%^Note - use of <offerall> to destroy gear belonging to other players is illegal.%^RESET%^  It is an ooc tool to facilitate keeping items cleaned up and not to be used in RP situations.  Please do clean up and don't leave items laying around though, because they add to lag and will cause more frequent reboots.

Typing %^BOLD%^<brief> %^RESET%^will toggle on/off to change if you see the full room description or just the short name and exits when you move around.  Brief mode may save you lag on entering a room, but be sure to look closely at the room descriptions and items in the descriptions or you'll miss important things.  Think like a real adventurer who needs to be fully aware of their surroundings.  Using %^BOLD%^<briefcombat>%^RESET%^ is highly recommended to cut down on spam and lag in combat for both you and anyone else in the room seeing your combat.  It will also shorten the message from the offer command.

The %^BOLD%^<last> %^RESET%^command is very useful if you get disconnected or think you missed something in spam or reading help files.  For example, typing %^BOLD%^<last newbie> %^RESET%^will show the last several lines from that channel.  It works for linename, say, and emote.
