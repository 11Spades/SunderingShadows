4: Quests
   A> Quests exist in many forms. We commonly term them as quests, mini 
      quests, random quests and avatar quests. They are all made to add 
      more structure to the adventuring lives of the characters. Many 
      people have had lots of fun figuring out quests. This is what we 
      are striving for in the quests. 
      
   B> Giving out quest information is illegal. This means telling 
      someone how to do a quest as well as walking them through it 
      when you already know how to do the quest. People partying to
      to do a quest for the first time is fine. There are also areas
      that are considered "quest-like" - this basically means there
      is some trick to getting out. Telling someone how to get through
      one of these areas will be treated the same as a true quest.
      If you are caught giving out quest information, you will be
      warned once and then rid.
      
   C> You may not lead people through quest areas. If you are providing 
      (hired mercenary) to people adventuring through quest areas you may
      not provide any information about the quest or specials. You will 
      have to absorb the effects of the other character's decisions. This
      protection must remain at a reasonable level. If the character has
      no chance of surviving on his/her own and is staying alive solely by 
      your presence this would also be considered breaking the quest rules.
