Clerics and paladins must choose a god/goddess to follow at creation. All others are encouraged to choose a god/goddess to follow and promote their cause. General information can be found for each deity in help by their name and their charges are found in their temples. Temples are scattered around the realm  and found by exploring and/or asking other characters ICly (after you leave newbiehood).  

Interacting with others is also a good way to find fellow faithful and learn about the practical application and nuances of the faith. Of course, each faith has enemies as well. Note that the concept of gods in D&D is more like Greek mythology than modern religions. Even if you choose one god/goddess to follow, you might very well pray to or make offerings to some others also.
