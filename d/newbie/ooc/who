Concerning typing <%^BOLD%^who%^RESET%^>...

1.) Why do I not see any names on the "who" listing?

People on the who listing are currently unknown to you. You will first have to <%^BOLD%^recognize%^RESET%^> them before you will be able to call them by name (including yourself). This allows for player's to provide nicknames, or even false names, rather than their real name. Please see <%^BOLD%^help recognize%^RESET%^> for more information.

2.) What does the letters K, A, and F after some names on the "who" list mean?

In the spirit of fun and fairness, ShadowGate has implemented a system to determine who is an appropriate party member for you, as well as who you are able to participate in playerkilling with.

A %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^K%^RESET%^ means you are free to party with, and engage in pk with, that person.

An %^YELLOW%^A%^RESET%^ means you may adventure with, but not playerkill, that person.

An %^BOLD%^%^RED%^F%^RESET%^ means you are forbidden to participate in both parties

and playerkilling with that person.

Please see <%^BOLD%^help wholist%^RESET%^> for more information.
