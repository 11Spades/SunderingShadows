Question #2 & related items from the FAQ file

2) Why do I not see any names on the "who" listing?
 
People on the who listing are currently unknown to you. You will first have to <recognize> them, before you will be able to call them by name.  You can refer them to by race and a number. but you will also be included this list as well, so be careful.  Should you want to appear as something other than your race (Which is highly suggested...) please check out the command <adjective> and the help that comes with it.

2b) What these symbols on the who list mean?..

Be sure to read <help who>, if you want to know! Up to date information will be placed there.
