Some of them may seem obvious, but how well you portray your character is VERY important to gaining respect as someone who is here to role-play.  This is not a hack and slash video game.  Role-play and interaction is expected and you will enjoy the experience much more if you take time to develop a vision of your character's looks, attitudes, and mannerisms.
