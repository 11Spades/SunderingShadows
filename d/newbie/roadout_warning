expected to know and to follow all the rules, just like 
everyone else.  Before you go any further, you should 
read (or re-read) the following help files and be SURE 
you understand them.

We do watch for OOC (out of character) abuse, which includes 
going to areas that your character has no knowledge of even 
if you know where it is from previous characters.  Read all 
signs you come across and follow them as your character would.  
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^DO NOT %^RESET%^go racing off to cities that are not on the signs and 
maps you come across.  Instead, explore the areas we have 
worked hard to create for you to make these lower levels fun and interesting.
