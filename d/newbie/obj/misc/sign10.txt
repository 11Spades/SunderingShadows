%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Many useful items such as those found in the general store have instructions or at least hints about how to use them.  You should see them when you %^WHITE%^< look > %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^at the item.  Keep in mind that the syntax or commands for what to do won't always be in the <> in room or item descriptions to make it stand out or even be given exactly.   However, with a little thought and experimentation you should be able to figure it out from the information you are given.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^< help shop >%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^ will usually work in shops.  Many commands such as list, show, sell, and buy will work the same in most.  However, some shops and wandering NPCs have special commands.  Be sure to have them %^BOLD%^show %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^you items before you buy so you can be sure of things like size or the type of lantern oil you'll get.

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Don't forget to try to interract with NPCs such as shopkeepers and also some of the special mobs.  If they are designed to be interractive, they should respond to words that are relevant to their purpose.  For example, the armorer might answer questions about helms or what armor a thief might prefer.  Some of them will randomly provide helpful guidance also.  Pay attention to what they say and don't hesitate to talk to them (just use say like you do with PCs and experiment).  You might learn something very useful.
