%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^This area may look rather mundane but there are some rooms where you will be able to < %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^search (something) > %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^and find things of use.  If you use your head you can probably figure out which rooms would be most likely candidates.  Also note - even if you don't have any luck searching something in one room, you might find that same thing searchable in another. 

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^You will also find you may need %^YELLOW%^climbing tools %^GREEN%^nearby to %^WHITE%^< descend > %^GREEN%^and %^WHITE%^< climb > %^GREEN%^back out.  If you don't have a set yet and don't have the skills of a thief to climb unaided, now would be a good time to start carrying them.  Be warned that it leads to what is meant to be the most dangerous area in newbieland - for those who can survive most of the other areas.  You will want to seek it out and explore before you leave though, especially when you can gather companions to help out.

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Also, think about RP (role-play) reasons to gather a party to go places like that, especially once you discover what is there.  It's never too early to think about why your character is doing these things.  Are you trying to rid the world of all evil beings - or good beings that will interfere with your evil ways?  Is your primary goal to help protect the weak, gain favor with local residents, help restore balance, or....?
