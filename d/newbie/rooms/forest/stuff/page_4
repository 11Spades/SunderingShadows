%^GREEN%^Growingdays

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Now I think I know what happened to that village that's in ruins.  The drow must have either tunneled to the church or conquered it and decided to move in.  Thankfully I haven't seen any raiding parties leave their lair yet but it's probably just a matter of time.  May all the gods of goodness and light give me strength to slay as many as possible so they don't grow braver and stronger in numbers and overtake the new city.

%^ORANGE%^I wonder if some of the undead in that cemetary to the south are some of their creations too.  Maybe Kelemvor will keep looking kindly on returning me when I do fall in battle if I release them from their undeath so they can finally rest.
