%^YELLOW%^Sundays - The town I found in this land is nice enough, but I miss the forest so I've spent most of my time there.  At first the kobolds and snakes were almost too much for me, and even those frogs around the lake.  I'm learning how to use my sword and magic much better now.  Thankfully I found some scrolls to study and some gems and coins careless travelers lost here and there.  Those bees sure sting bad when I stir up a nest though.
