%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^I ventured into some hills east of the town and the forest.  Gnomes are mining there.  Seems to be where the gems come from that I've found around.  They said some of their kin had gone to the forest to hunt and gather berries and not returned too.  I suppose they weren't so lucky with the kobold and bugbears.  I've been helping escort them lately and they seem really grateful.
