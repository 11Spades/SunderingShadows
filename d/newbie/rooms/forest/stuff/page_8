Dear mother and father,

I'm sending you these notes from a journal I've been keeping so you can see what I've found here.  I'm making another set to send later in case the voadkyn I gave these to doesn't find you.  I'm learning a great deal, especially magic, but some of the components are pretty expensive and often hard to find when I need them.

I've been defeated in battle and visited Kelemvor a few times, but thankfully Selune sent me back to learn from my mistakes.  I still pray to the Moonmaiden every night to keep you safe.  I hope by killing the evil creatures in the forests here and healing those deserving of it I'm serving her well.
