%^RED%^Colddays

%^RED%^Guess maybe I'd better choose if I'm going to see if I can stay with the gnomes in their tents or get a room in Offestry for the cold months.  Some of the townspeople have been making offerings to Auril to appease her but I doubt she'll ease up any time soon.  

I've managed to find some useful items that people have lost or tossed aside in the forest undergrowth.  I've even found scrolls to practice and learn more about magic from.  It is troubling how so many apparently toss Mystra's gifts so carelessly aside but at least many of them are still in good enough condition to study or use.
