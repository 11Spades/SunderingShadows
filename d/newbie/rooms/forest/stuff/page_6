%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^There's an old keep north of those hills and mining camp too.  I've made a few friends good with picking locks and the like now too.  The rogues sure come in handy to find those nasty traps, wish I could learn to find and disarm them.  It's been a real challenge and even has secret passages.  We spent days poking around there and I'll bet we still didn't find everything.
