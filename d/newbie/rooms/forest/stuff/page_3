%^MAGENTA%^I thought I was going to die and not even in battle.  There's a ravine in the southwest part I fell into trying to see what was under a boulder.  Without a path back up I was really afraid I was stuck and would starve.  I finally tried to climb out and found a spot I could manage though.  Found a little cave with some nasty centipedes and a decent dagger there too.
