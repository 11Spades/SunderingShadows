You are walking through some rolling hills. Small plants
cover the hills surrounding you. The hills flatten out some
to the west. There are tracks in the dirt and quite a few 
small tents scattered around the hills. It is very busy here,
and you can finally see the entrance to a mine deep in the 
hillside to the south.
