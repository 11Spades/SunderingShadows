//grove
/*
The room description here just reads a little
awkwardly. Maybe...In the autumn, this elven meadow changes to shades of
orange and red as trees prepare for the winter and tendrils of cool mist
blanket it.  Many beautiful and mystical plants shed their leaves, falling
near several trees with in which huts can be seen. The grace of the Elven
people echoes in every aspect of this place and from the north comes a soft
crashing of water falling down from a steep cliff.  Beautiful streams flow
through the groves their water warming the grove.
