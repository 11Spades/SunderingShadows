This area will be a large adventure area for levels 25+.  I plan to have
the surface, where there will be two abandoned towns - one was mostly
human, the other mixed races on the edge of the forest.  There will also be
a semi-working gnomish town.  They've refused to give up and will have new
gadgets like cannons, etc.  There will be a mountainous area in the center,
with a few giant type things and possibly high up in the area, some
celestial types who have come to fight the spriggans below.  The main
adventure areas will be below ground, where creatures called spriggans have
mined and tunnelled.  They are gnome-kin who have mixed with the demons
below, all of which will be explorable areas.  This is a brief overview
now.  More to come with maps soon.
