%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Adventurers! %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Travelers! %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Those with a strong WanderLust!

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Heed my Call! 

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^I am Arsheeva Wynder, a Nomadic Warrior-Priest of Kelemvor, perhaps you have never heard of me? 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^It is no matter. We are set this Lightday, during the 11th Renewal, in year 729 to cleanse the Island%^BOLD%^%^RED%^ of Eldebaro of the Undead Filth that plagues it. 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^We have an Enclave from which we have been observing the Island for some number of years, %^BOLD%^%^RED%^and we believe that there is hidden on the island a most foul source of curses, diseases, and %^BOLD%^%^RED%^dark magic. 

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^We seek to eradicate the very SOURCE! We are now seeking any who would aid us in this cause!

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^If you are brave enough or smitten with enough wanderlust to make the journey, you shall find the %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^island at the coordinates : 7, 51. Go forth and slay as many undead as you can find!!

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Our enclave shall be watching and once enough of the filth have been removed from the island %^BOLD%^%^RED%^you will be Rewarded and our exploration for the source can begin in earnest!

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Penned, this Lightday, during the 11th Renewal, in the year 729 by Arsheeva Wyndar

%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^OOC: Anyone who wants to do so can participate simply by traveling to Eldebaro and killing%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^ undead monsters on the island. This plot is going to be used to introduce changes to the island.%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^ If you don't know I sometimes create items that have a 'little extra' (such as some rare/weird curse) %^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^and I believe because of the changes that are coming to Eldebaro the reward for helping out here will%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^ likely reflect my penchant for that. I do not forsee this lasting for more than a few weeks depending%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^ on RL circumstances. There is no need to mail me or anything - the game will be tracking the undead that%^B_CYAN%^%^YELLOW%^ you kill on Eldebaro. If you do have questions though, feel free to mail! Enjoy!
