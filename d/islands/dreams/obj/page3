	I fear something is wrong, terribly wrong.  Again we had nightmares.  And again we dreamt we were together.  Me and Comadon together, and Liradia and Salegord together.  But the worst part is Frywan.  We found him white as the moonlight this morning.  At first we feared he had freed himself from his shackles.  We had attached his chains to the center post of the hut Comadon and Salegord put together.  

	But Frywan was in no condition to harm us, or free himself.  The loss of %^RED%^blood%^RESET%^ has taken a serious toll upon his health.  I couldn't stand the site of his bloody stump of an arm.  We took the shackles off of his left wrist, and I called upon Lysara's light to restore some of the life to him, and to stop the bleeding.  He begs us to give him a dagger before he goes to %^GREEN%^sleep%^RESET%^ tonight.  And to leave the shackles off.  I am inclined to leave him free, but I can not arm such a notorious murderer under such stressful conditions.  But the horrible story he had to tell...a shadow demon snatching his shackles in a smooth swing...spinning him around with such force his arm was ripped apart.  And he seems to face his dreams alone.  At least we have the comfort of each other in our nightmares.

	It isn't just Frywan either.  Salegord has a huge bruise across his thigh.  He says he was hit by a shadow creature in his dreams, and he felt as if he were going to die, had it not been for a well placed lightning bolt from Liradia.  And she dreamt the same thing.  And my shoulder aches.  I actually feel as if I had swung my moonblade all night, and not just dreamt it.

	Clouds fill the sky today.  I can only pray it clears up, I MUST seek Lysara's guidance before I %^GREEN%^sleep%^RESET%^ again.
