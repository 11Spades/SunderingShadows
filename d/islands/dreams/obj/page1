	I don't really know where to begin...I just have to find a way to pass the time.  It has only been a few hours, but already the depression has set in.  Perhaps I should say who I am, so in case...in the event...should we not make it off of this island, at least those back home might find out what happened.  

	My name is Adilon, and I am a high priest of Lady Graymantle.  I have been employed by the city of Daggerdale for several years now, serving as a liaison, an ambassador if you will, to many of the cities that lie off the coast.  

	For this cursed trip, we were in the process of extraditing a terrible assassin back to Seneca.  This vile man, who sits in his chains across from me even as I write this, has been accused of butchering close to a dozen innocent folks in their sleep, for no better reason than greed.  

	But that doesn't really matter right now.  We are stuck in this together.  Aside from me and Frywan (the aforementioned murderer) stranded on this isle are my escorts:  Comadon, a stout and serious but extremely reliable paladin of Kreysneothosies; Salegord, a sell-sword warrior who seems to be in the favor of the Trickster; and finally young Liradia, a spell weaver, only a few years out of her apprenticeship.  We were to deliver Frywan to those in Seneca who would see him stand for his crimes, and then after a short stay return.  Liradia was after some components for her research and hoped to find what she needed.  

	But I am rambling.  It keeps my mind off of dark thoughts.  I must seek Lysara's grace to light my way.  I'm sure you wonder how we got here.  I shudder to think about it, so I shall be brief.  We left late yesterday from port, and it quickly became nightgloom.  I felt uneasy, from the onset, as it was a cloud filled sky.  It seems Ryorik wanted to wreak havoc.  A storm quickly brewed, sending us into complete darkness.  Our small ship was tossed and turned about.  With no stars to navigate, and without the Lady Graymantle's  light to guide us, we ran ashore.  Our boat was ripped apart.  

	I am grateful the waters were so shallow, or I fear the armor of our two more heavily armored friends would have surely faced a horrible death.  We were able to wade ashore.  We have spent much of the morning diving after our lost goods.  By luck, I had packed this along with the extridition papers in a sealed container.  

	The sun is setting, it will soon be moonlight.  I shall place my faith in She Who Sees Beyond.  She surely has a purpose for me, and I shall do as she wishes.
