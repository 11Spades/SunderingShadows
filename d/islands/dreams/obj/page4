	Please, if you are reading this, leave now if you can.  If you can't leave, I hope your fate fares better than that of mine and my companions...

	We are all that is left of the small traveling party, myself and Salegord that is.  The others were missing when we awoke.  I beg of you, do not %^GREEN%^sleep%^RESET%^ on this forsaken island...the shadowlands seem to take us away each night to face the demons of our dreams.

	And what demons they are...amid the confusion of your surroundings, the demons seem to just flow out of nothing at you.  Poor Comadon...I couldn't save him.  Several nights of battle instead of sleep took their final toll, though Kreysneothosies would be proud...he died as the claws of a shadow demon met his throat. I should have been able to do more, Lady Graymantle knows I tried.  Weariness took their toll at Comadon's expense.  I collapsed, thinking the shadow's latest show of fury was over...but one remained in the void, biding its time. Comadon stepped between me and it, impaling the demon with his glowing sword, even as it ripped away at his face and neck.

	He collapsed, gasping for air he no longer could breathe...and before I could mutter a prayer to the Triple Goddess, he began to fade away...as if being sucked into the shadows around us. 

	I awoke soon afterwards to find only Salegord left.  He seems reluctant to talk or even make eye contact anymore...I fear he knows the truth: we shall not make it through another night...
