	I don't know how much I can write today. I am exhausted. I was plagued with nightmares last night. It must be due to the stress from the events of yesterday. Looking about, it seems none of us slept well. Ahh, tis to be expected I guess.  But I shall seek Lysara's guidance today.  

	I must say, however.  I am a little disturbed. After chatting with my fellows this morning, it seems that both myself and Comadon dreamt of each other, in very similar fashions.  Horrible creatures attacking us. I even FEEL as if I had to fight for my life all night. Liradia and Salegord tell a similar story as well.

	The sky is clear, and the air crisp. It looks as if Lady Graymantle's light shall bathe us as we sleep, which will surely alleviate our dark dreams. Comadon wants to construct some form of a hut, and Salegord is attempting to rig his arrows to skewer a few fish. They seem to be finding ways to distract themselves, although I think Salegord is simply trying to impress Liradia.

	I shall write more when I have a chance.  Comadon requires my assistance.
