    You are at the southernmost tip of Attaya island.  You feel a sudden sense of invincibility as you stand tall against the wind at the very tip of the island.  The ocean stretches out all around you and you watch the waves' motions as they seem to envelop the island.  You shut your eyes briefly, and almost feel as though you are flying...  You quickly come out of it as you nearly lose your balance.
    Strangely, you feel as some part of you wanted to jump from the cliff to the sea, as though it were calling to you.
    The path jumps down to a ledge about 5 feet beneath you.  It winds down to the eastern beach.
