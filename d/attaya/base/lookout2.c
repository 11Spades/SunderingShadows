    You are at the center span of the bridge now.  The world around you seems unusually serene up here over the reflection pool.  A large brass bench sits upon a small raised area near the railing where you can sit and think.  The waters below are completely clear and are magnificent as the surface reflects the scene above you.
    Not far to the south is the guarded entrance to the south wall fortress.
