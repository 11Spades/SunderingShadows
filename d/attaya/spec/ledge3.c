%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^You are on a ledge on the Obsidian Staircase. The ledge is fairly narrow here, and you are at constant risk of falling off. It is very cold at this level. You begin to shiver violently, and long for the warm beach. A few snowflakes drift past you and the winds chill you to the bone. A thin white haze, perhaps from snow clouds your view of the ocean in the distance. Far above you, are the walls to the Crystalline Tower of the Black Dawn. You cannot see the tower itself because the walls are too high, and you are a long way beneath them.");
