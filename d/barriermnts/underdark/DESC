The Lothwaite underdark consists of an underwater area in the lake, and the underdark proper.  The underdark directly beneath the village is a kuo-toan settlement called Bli'joolip, which is run by the Sunken Council.  This is a group of nine high-level clerics who in turn serve the Sea Mother, Blibdoolpoolp.  The city will be completely submerged in parts, requiring water breathing spells or other forms of breathing.


There will be a large church - the Cathedral of the Sea Mother - that is the central adventure area.  The spawning pools below will be fiercely protected.  A small, hidden tunnel that is completely submerged beneath the easternmost spawning pool will lead to a brooding force hidden behind the kuo-toa - an ancient aboleth.  Hints in the church will suggest that it is not only the Council running the city and will point to the aboleth.

In addition to these things, there will be drow emissary parties sent to trade and do other business with the kuo-toa, specifically trade and buy slaves.  These drow will, naturally, be targets for adventuring groups as well, especially all non-drow.

The city itself will be a non-quest area, while the Cathedral will provide a quest.  The Cathedral is protected by strong clerical magic, and it is not possible to exit once you enter without gathering the nine gems known as the Sea Mother's Tears.  These are shards of a gem that shattered when the once-great kuo-toa settlement in the Sakrune Sea was destroyed by a band of do-gooder sea elves.
