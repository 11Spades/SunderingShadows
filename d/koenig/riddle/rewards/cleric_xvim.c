%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Fashioned out of steel, this ornate morning star looks lavish and rich.  The long steel handle is carved with images of eyes peering out of the blackened steel.  The eyes are actually made of %^GREEN%^emeralds%^BLACK%^  and %^GREEN%^bl%^RED%^ood%^GREEN%^stones%^BLACK%^, giving an eerie life like glimmer to them.  Inlays of %^YELLOW%^gold%^BLACK%^ and %^WHITE%^platinum%^BLACK%^ bands wrap around the cylindrial handle. A large square cut %^GREEN%^emerald%^BLACK%^ is set into the bottom of the handle, clutched by three black talons. The top of the morning star is set with a solid sphere, made up of %^YELLOW%^gold%^BLACK%^ and %^WHITE%^platinum%^BLACK%^, the metals set in a rigid orderly pattern.  Blackened steel spikes rise out of the gilded sphere, sharpened to fine deadly points.

The Scepter of the Tyrannt's Reign is veiwed as many as the divine symbol of The Lord of Strife's right to rule the lands.  It is said the Tyrannt allows only those who are of noble blood can even wield the scepter effectively.  There is a history that each tyrannat, warlord, or nobleman who's managed to carve out a bloody dynasty in these lands has come about due to the scepter's arrival in their hands.
