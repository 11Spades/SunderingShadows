Nine long lean strands of black leather have been attached to a mithril hilt.  The hilt is wrapped in a similar leather that has minute barbs poking out.  The extensions from the whip, on a closer inspection, are imbedded with mithril barbs.  The strands are divided as such, three possessing a %^RED%^red%^RESET%^ hued metal, three with %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^silvery blue%^RESET%^ barbs, and the final three, %^MAGENTA%^deep violet%^RESET%^.
