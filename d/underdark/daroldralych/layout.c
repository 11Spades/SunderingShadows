%^BLUE%^%^BOLD%^City status: %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Darol'dralych is not as much a 'drow city', as more of an outpost for a greater drow city below, known as "Qi'sztovir" in the drow tongue.  Only newly established, it has been placed in close proximity to the surface, in an effort to broaden the power and reach of this greater city.  It is a go-between for general produce and slaves to Juran, already making a tidy profit and a name for itself.  As such, Darol'dralych is not a large establishment by drow standards, consisting only of perhaps thirty noble houses in its entirety.  Of course, all facilities are still provided for as noble drow would not expect to live with anything less.  It is still considered matriarchial society, as with most drow cities: it is ruled primarily by the priesthood, and all houses are led by a Matron.  City security and guard is upheld by the third house, Zanyl'thirr.

%^BLUE%^%^BOLD%^Religious status: %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The primary worship here is of Shar, who represents the normal status of Lloth in a drow city.  The secondary power is that of Bane, who since he is also a deity of darkness (as Shar is), is seen as the militant extension of the church (similar in position to Selvetarm in drow style, but not subservient to the Sharran priesthood).  Paying respects to most other evil gods is permitted, as the priesthood wishes no ill to come of disrespect to these powers: Loviatar, Malar, Mask, Kossuth, and to a lesser extent, Talos and Auril.  There is a strong, unspoken undercurrent of Maskarran worship within many houses, similar in manner to the Vhaeraunites of standard drow cities, although they are not the opposing, hunted faith as Vhaeraun generally is - generally Maskarrans are accepted, albeit less vocally than Shar and Bane.  The only dark god not well tolerated in the city is Cyric, mainly because of the strong following of Shar, Bane and Mask in the area: thus the few drow/houses that worship Cyric, do so in secrecy.  Beshaba has a small, fairly new following and is generally ignored by the populace.  Auppenser is paid homage to by the ninth house Kirrefyrm, because of their psionicist bloodline - other than this, he is also ignored within the city.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Following are the city's houses, 1 through 5 are the upperclass (ruling circle), 6 through 12 are the middleclass, and the remainder are the lower class (most lower class are unnamed).  Listed in the format of:  %^WHITE%^#. housename (main service), alignment, main god of worship.  Alliances and emnities within the city, and key NPCs within the house.

Adopted because of her favour with the Sharran church, N'sykah proceded to covertly work the house.  Upon the move to the new city, Shyntstra ascended to Matron of the new house, as eldest daughter and N'sykah's convenient puppet.

Items of interest for the shops:

Nekodes: yeah, it's a glove with spikes in the palm - used as a weapon and as a climbing tool

(Circe) replies: flutter blades (serrated blade with a center-mounted hinge and handle - kind of like a big switchblade) - butterfly knife.

(Circe) replies: nightscale (snakeskin armor steeped in alchemical mixtures - a lot like leather except black and more supple)

(Circe) replies: tentacled hide - self-descriptive :P but it gives a trip attack. a rubbery suit of hide with long, sweeping tentacles attached at the bottom.

drow boots/cloak - bonuses when indoors

then there's alchemist's mineral acid, which is a grenade of acid basically :P

(Circe) replies: Hmm...a caveharp, which is a masterwork instrument (the sound carries well in caves)

(Circe) replies: Shriek paste...made from that shrieking fungus stuff.  If it's exposed to light, it shrieks :P

(Circe) replies: bloodthirsty is one of the things that can be added.  If the wielder doesn't kill something every 4 hours, the blade gets mad.  They get a +2 attack bonus so long as it's happy

(Circe) replies: illithidwrought is another...it has almost a mind of its own, sometimes doing its own thing.  It gives a +1 insight bonus to attack and damage

(Circe) replies: then there's morphing....it can switch to any weapon of the same basic type size (so like a one-handed mace could switch to a flail or a sword)

(Circe) replies: stalactite...this one's kind of powerful.  It doesn't do anything except make the blade look like a stalactite, but it gives it the chance to turn the target to stone on a critical hit

(Circe) replies: hmm...Final Rest...it's a +1 Undead Bane longsword that does 2d6 points of damage to undead

(Circe) replies: Hand Spinneret - +3 unholy hand crossbow - so additional 1d6 damage to good creatures, and the wielder can use Web three times a day

(Circe) replies: Queen's Scourge - +2 scourge whip that appears to be crafted of thick webs woven through with cruel barbs.  Can do cause critical wounds once a day (maybe a minor special to cause light or something?)

(Circe) replies: Spiderbane...+2 spiked chain that hurts spiders more

(Circe) replies: Death Armor - +3 badass armor :P  it's glamered, so the wearer can make it look like whatever, and it has lots of other stuff.  It's legendary armor (it gives bonuses to hide in shadows, escape, and move silently, plus it's spiked and it lets the wearer use greater invis once a day)

(Circe) replies: Exoarmor - made by illithids, +2 full plate, gives the player a carapaced look

(Circe) replies: hmm..rings...antivenom ring - once a day, wearer can neutralize poison on himself. rings of darkness, charges or per/day use?

(Circe) replies: Okay, rods...Rod of the Dead - touch it to corpses to animate them

(Circe) replies: Rod of Webspinning...in the book, it gives the wielder +2 to ac (spiderskin effect), +2 against poison, and +2 on hide in shadows.  They can also use Web three times a day

(Circe) replies: Cloak of Stone...magical cloak that grants +5 to hide, but it might be neat to make it do something else.  Dunno what though (it's mottled gray, looks like stone)

(Circe) replies: messenger medallion - once a day, gives telepathy

(Circe) replies: spider mask - four spiderlike, jointed, wire legs protrude from either side of this black velvet mask.  Gives darkvision

(Circe) replies: Web Choker - strung of barbs and black webbing, with nine gray spheres descending from it, the choker is considered high fashion for a drow priestess.  You can tear off the spheres and hurl them for a web spell.  Once they're all gone, it's useless

(Circe) replies: Ring of arachnid control, hmm...maybe summon a little spider or something?

(Circe) replies: reply wand of darkness, has charges, casts darkness

(Circe) replies: ooh...whip of fangs.  It's a whip with an adamantite handle and five living snakes :P only drow priestesses can use them, and they're ownered

(Circe) replies: last one is a death lance - could be tricksy since here lances are only for knightly types.  But they're 10'long lances or spears made of mottled gray material.  They're usually used by drow gards and use negative entergy to hurt peoples

Potions: all standard, MR potion (rare), potions of strength/dex/etc (rare), sleep potion (rare), greater invis?
