"and while never having posed any threat, it seemed that now the psionic monsters had unleashed something far more "
"horrific than themselves upon the world.  From the depths came a terrifying abomination, a creation cast out when the "
"illithids could no longer control it; an insane beast known as a vampire illithid.  It lashed out at her, and resolutely "
"she held her ground, dealing grievous wounds upon it.  Finally, in its last breath the madness and pain were too much to "
"bear, and as the creature died it unleashed such a great concussion of psionic energies that it literally tore Sylana "
"apart.\n\n%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Her remains were found many years later by a band of roving adventurers.  Among them was "
"Sylana's shield, shredded nearly to pieces but still retaining enough latent psionic energy to hold its pieces together"
