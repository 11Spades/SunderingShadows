/*Adapted from Bane's Laerad commandos by Styx for the Shadow jail
- Should we set him to no dominate?
- Why won't he wield the key?  Made it wearable and that works, but still..
- Features > attacks people trying to unlock the door or pick the lock
-> Jails bound people & records their name in a list
-> Checks to be sure he's at the jail before taking them
-> Will call Shadow watch and has "shadow law" id so they won't attack him
by Styx - 3/31/02
-- Figure out how to make him yell shut up in there if someone yells?

dark hair is rather unkempt.  A heavy chain hangs from a wide, heavy
leather belt and the key in his hand is attached to the other end. 
Massive corded biceps bulge between the thick, rough leather vest he wears
and leather bracers on his lower arms.  Heavy leather boots come to his
knees and Altogether his appearance makes his surly attitude that much
more disconcerting.  Heavily scarred, he's obviously seen his share of
combat and probably knows how to handle himself.  He does, however, look
quite ready to jail about anyone and might even take a prisoner off your
hands."
