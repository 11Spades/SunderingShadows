The scoring hand types are as follows:\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^Scoring Hands\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^High card%^RESET%^ - If no other scoring combinations are available, players' hands are compared on the basis of the highest card. Each player's highest card is considered first if two or more players have the same highest card, consideration moves to their second highest cards and so on.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^A pair%^RESET%^ - Two cards of the same value. E.g. two fours or two Rogues, etc. If more than one player has a pair, the player with the highest value pair wins. If two players each have a pair of the same value, the values of their other cards are considered.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Two Pair%^RESET%^ - two pairs of different values in the same hand. E.g Two rogues and two fives, or two hunters and two threes. If two or more players each have two pairs, the value of each player's highest pair is considered first, then the value of the second highest pair if there is a draw. If two players each have two pairs of identical values, the non-scoring card is considered.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Three of a kind%^RESET%^ Three cards of the same value in the same hand%^RESET%^. If two players can each make a hand with three of a kind of the same value (possible due to the shared community cards), the values of their remaining cards are considered to separate them.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^A straight%^RESET%^ - five cards of consecutive values. E.g a three, a four, a five, a six and a seven. Rogues can either be high(ten, hunter, damesel, lord, rogue) or low (rogue, two, three, four, five). If two players each have a straight, the highest value straight wins.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^A flush%^RESET%^ - Five cards of the same suit in a hand. If two or more players each have a flush, the value of the cards are considered.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Full house%^RESET%^ - Three of a kind, plus a pair in the same hand. If two players both have full houses, the values of the threes are considered first, then the values of the pairs.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Four of a kind%^RESET%^ - Four cards of the same value in a hand. If two players each have four of a kind, the values of the fours are considered first, then the values of their non-scoring cards.\n"
+"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Straight flush%^RESET%^ - Five consecutive cards of the same suit (eg four, five, six, seven and eight of gems). If two players each have a straight flush, the values of their cards are considered.\n"
"%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Royal Flush%^RESET%^ - Ten, hunter, damsel, lord and rogue of the same suit. The highest scoring hand possible and a guaranteed win unless someone else has the same (possible due to the shared community cards).\n"

+"After the cards are dealt, there follow several rounds of betting, during which the community cards are progressively revealed. After the first round of betting, the first three community cards are revealed. There is then a second round of betting, then the fourth community card is revealed. After third round of betting the final community card is revealed. There is then one final round of betting with all the community cards revealed.\n"

The player may also continue in a hand where the highest bet has risen above the player's bet limit.
