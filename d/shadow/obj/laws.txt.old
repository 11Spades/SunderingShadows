The Laws of Shadow under the current 
Martial Law are as follows:

Stealing - Will not be tolerated, if caught execution will result

Fighting - As the who's and whats are impossible to determine, 
	   All combatants will be executed.

Races - Races who are known to consistantly cause disorder
	will be executed on sight. Those include:
	Orc, gnoll, bugbear, ogre, drow, goblin, hobgoblin
	kobold, ogre-mage, and all bastard half-kin.

Sedition - Anyone making public statements against the proper
      rule of Law in Shadow, or inciting unrest, will be subject to a fine,
      as determined by the Magistrate. Non payment of said fine will
      result in banishment from the city on pain of death.


The laws are to be enforced by the watch and guards. All
residents, visitors, and occupants of Shadow agree to abide
by the laws by entering the sovereign City of Shadow.
