You are on a small ledge approximately 75 feet up the side of the cliff 
face.  The path continues to the east and the south here, as it passes a 
large dark cave which, no doubt, leads deep underground.  To the south, 
the path winds down a steep cliff, and to the east, the path is a bit 
more level.  An impressive crystalline building stands on the 
mountainside to the northeast.
