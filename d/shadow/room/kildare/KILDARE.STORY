Kildare Glen is an old independent settlement originally established during the years of the fief of Drogheda, around the 3rd century SG.  The fief of Drogheda was long-standing as a province of a much larger kingdon, but the lord of Drogheda had become overly greedy as well as increasingly paranoid.  He set down laws forbidding those serfs in his province from having weapons or armor of any kind, and he set about making life harder for them by demanding more and more in the way of goods and crops every year.  Meanwhile, he sat in his nice keep north of Echoes Mountains and reaped all the rewards.  Kildare Glen was not technically under the lord's dominion, but he tried to impose the same restrictions on them.  In return, they began helping the peasants of Drogheda stockpile weapons and armor in the shape of ordinary clothing and farming implements.  In the year 332 SG, the leaders of Drogheda led a revolt against the lord, in which they battled his forces and eventually left most all of them dead.  The lord's keep was abandoned, but it is said that he survived.

Kildare Glen itself remained a peaceful pastoral village until some time early in the 600s SG.  It was around the year 625 that Kildare Glen became a place of waking nightmares.  A strange group of creatures called perytons invaded the once peaceful dale, and began attacking villagers and consuming them.  The residents of Kildare Glen have had no choice but to stay where they are, as their whole means of life is in the valley.  Several residents have fled, but the majority have stayed, exhibiting the same resilient spirit shown by the peasants of Drogheda.  Their village elder and guide, Caldon and Guyon, are searching for answers, but none have yet been found.  A strange blind woman of the village, Soren, claims the whole story is tied to her twin, who disappeared nearly fifty years ago.  Some scoff at this idea, but others aren't quite as sure...
