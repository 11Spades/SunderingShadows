README hahah you fell for it

The orginal idea for this area was to add some depth to the popular echo mountians.

Basicly, it tries to keep the original feel but add more stuff to do like the newer areas.  

The general overview is that one finds a underground cliff and can either fall or climb down.  Falling hurts more.  They come to a small camp with an invisible drow spy (that seems all the testers have missed) who is keeping tabs on the ogre's fight against the echo dwarves.  He makes some money catching slaves and sending them back to the underdark too.

However, further into the caverns there is a small cult of malarite hunters who seem to think hunting drow is a thrill.  Players can get a hint as to the fact that there is a hidden drow after traveling to the far corner of the tunnels.  

Also, there are several mini quests, helping a dwarf in a cave in (gives them the key to the malarite place) freeing some captive dwarves and helping a gnome who had his machine broken.

It's filled with cave dwelling monsters, this area is designed to be harder to melee then for casters (many monsters trip).  

Also, lore can be found, the general plot is that the ogres near tabor were getting squashed, there are only a few of them left.  A bulk of them were led by drow to attack the mines however adventurers killed the drow leader and the ogre infighting has been the saviour of the dwarves.
