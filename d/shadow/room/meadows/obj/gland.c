It’s very rare to find a gland from a fire beetle that has not been ruptured.  Wizards and alchemists pay dearly for such a gland, it is said.  The glands seem to be used in the creation of spells and objects that rely on fire.  It’s speculated that these glands also are used in the summoning of a fire elemental.  Followers of Kossuth are known to string the glands onto golden chain and wear them as a badge of courage.
