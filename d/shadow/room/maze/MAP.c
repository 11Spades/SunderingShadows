        If any changes are made to this area, please notify
        Zeek about them thankx.

	These rooms can not be mapped, cuz they would go on forever,
	This area has a total of 15 rooms, that has scrambeled exits.
	I have a room at the start, that says that we are not responsible 
	to get anyone out if they are stuck, you may help if you want,
	but please kep it low, cuz we can't have all these people trying
	to find the treasure room, and get so lost that we help someone 
	every minute, and so on. 
	
	I have this made , so that when we find out that someone knows where 
	the treasure room is, we can change just the room that leads to it
	and put it somewhere else. I will post which room leads to it
	here, and if you change the placcement, please update this
	for the room, thankx
PS Please put where the treasure room can be entered from and please
allways put it as a hidden exit, with a different name each time.

	The treasure room is set for enterance from maze13.c as "bush"
