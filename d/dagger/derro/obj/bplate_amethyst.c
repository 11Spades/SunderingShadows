The sparkling purples of the amethyst also endear it to some adherents of Lord Shadow, and even a few followers of Kismet are drawn to its reportedly psionic properties.  These breastplates are said to be fashioned by a curious little creature who is fascinated with gemstones and their many colors and uses.  He is said to live well below the earth's surface, somewhere up north in the Dagger region.  There are only a few alive who know the secret of crafting such a plate from a single stone, and all of the methods involve magic.");
