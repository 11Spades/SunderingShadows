%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Notes on Kinaro:%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Kinaro is a mining outpost of a much larger dwarven city, Barak Morndin (mighty mountain peak). The greater city itself resides in the north-eastern mountains beyond dagger region, inaccessable except by tunnels through the mountain, or by flight. Kinaro is only one of several such outposts of the city, spread throughout the mountainrange, but it is one of the rare few that resides aboveground. Mithril, electrum, iron, and other such ores, as well as many gems, are mined deep belowground in these other outposts.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Kinaro itself has been established now for several centuries, as one of the first outposts of Barak Morndin to be established. Found in fair quantities in the various mines encircling kinaro are gold, silver, and copper, as well as malachite and azurite gemstones. In very minor quantities are also found platinum, palladium, arandur, opals, turquoise and diamonds. Kinaro is the only outpost that provides the highly-prized platinum and palladium to the city, and it is also the trade route used to access the human settlements south of the dagger mountains. The prime trade goes through Daggerdale (with its shared bank) to Torm and Shadow further south.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The town has been mostly undisturbed until recently, when the lower levels of Kinaro's mines breached underdark proper. This was soon discovered by scouts of the nearby drow city Darol'dralych, who thought to take advantage of the situation in a swift invasion to the surface, by way of Kinaro through to Daggerdale. Daggerdale was unprepared and razed to the ground, and Kinaro nearly so until reinforcements were sent from Barak Morndin. The city itself is now being rebuilt and greatly reinforced, as the dwarves have no wish to give up such valuable mines, but will not tolerate drow incursions.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^City relations - Barak Morndin:%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Daggerdale: particularly good. This city is the central point of commerce for Kinaro through to cities further south. Their banks are also linked.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Tonovi: particularly poor. Tonovi is known to have banned dwarves many years previous, and occasionally sells dwarven slaves. This has earned the enmity of Barak Morndin, and thus Kinaro, who refuse to offer any trade to them.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Darol'dralych: extremely poor. Darol'dralych initially attempted an invasion of Daggerdale through Kinaro, wiping out the human town and most of the mining settlement. A permanent enmity exists between the drow city and Barak Morndin, though neither seems to have the capacity to wipe the other out.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Torm: relatively good. One of the main southern human cities with which the dwarves trades, though indirectly through Daggerdale.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Shadow: relatively good. Another of the main southern human cities with which the dwarves trade, through daggerdale.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Antioch: marginally good. Minor trade relations for small quantities of metals.
