Hello guys, I assume you are a wiz who is surfing the directories
either finding an item (file) or searching for examples.
This is a warning about all the items in this directory.

All items in this dir are artifacts that should have only ONE copy
existing in the game. I would rather they don't have it but not
see 2 or more exist in the game.
So... please do NOT clone it for any player, EVEN the avatars.

I am serious about this.
