I have decided at last to give up the art of mage craft. It is not for me, and I should have done this long ago, despite what my father wanted for me. I feel in my heart that this is the right decision, although no one else seems to agree with me. The other mages have ridiculed me for not being able to make it as one of their own. But it was never my desire to become a mage, I simply did what my father wanted. I am afraid that he is very disappointed by my recent actions, but it is my life and I was miserable living it the way that he wished me to. While things at home have grown uncomfortable I have decided to go out to scout the outlying land. This too is causing a stir, for the elves of this city are happy in their peaceful bliss and do not wish the rest of the world to find them, it seems. We have been content for many years with no contact with the outside world, but we surely cannot live this way forever! I have promised, however, to tell no one of Aketon and to be careful so that no one might follow me back to the city when I return.

The world of the adventurer is truly the life for me! I have spent these last several months outside of Aketon, mostly in the area of the Dagger Reach. I have fought bandits and even battled a troll in his hut beneath a bridge! I found a magical ring on his corpse that seems to protect me during my battles. I stumbled upon a cave of ogres as well but had to quickly retreat, I am not yet experienced enough to fight those fearesome foes. I watched the city of Daggerdale from afar and I came to realize that humans are not as base and simplistic as I had been lead to believe. And then I came to the town of Tonovi... That evil and wretched place, I can barely contain my anger when I think about it, and I cannot find the words to describe such villiany! Long had we hated the town of Tonovi, and I am only now beginning to realize why. It is nearly impossible to believe that the same species that can be so nice and caring as I saw in Daggerdale can be so heartless and cruel to eachother mere miles away in another city. Instead of discouraging me this has only hardened my resolve to see more of the world. I have lead a sheltered life up until now, and I realize that I am still young by my family's standards, but I feel stifled in this place that was once so completely my home. I have decided that I shall venture further, perhaps take a journey across the seas. I am an accomplished fighter now, but I know my limitations and shall be careful.

I have just returned from my adventures after a year abroad. I traveled the seas by a boat that I obtained when pirates attacked the ferry I was on. We were able to kill the pirates, and with nothing else to do with the boat the grateful ferryman taught me how to navigate the sea with it. The feel of the sea and the wind and is wonderful, I felt absolutely free at last as I sailed from island to island to explore the realm. I do feel more at home in the forests, however, there is a quiet gentleness there that the sea most certainly lacks. Ah, to tell of all the adventures I have had and all the treasures I have found! I shall have to record them here, but I am weary from my travels and in vast need of a reverie.

I cannot believe that my father is so set against me! Why does he always have to have everything his way?! Can he not, for once in his life, realize that I am not a little boy anymore? I have my own mind, and I am capable of deciding what I wish to do! But what has he gone and done behind my back? He has asked the council to prevent me from journeying out again, and pleaded with the mages to take me back into their fold. I shall NEVER become a mage! It is simply not in my blood, nor my heart. I love this life that I have begun to lead. I am a skilled fighter and I have helped many people in the world, which is much better than sitting in this vast forest and hoping that nobody will find us! I shall have words with my father about this, I still cannot believe he asked the council to forbid me from venturing out again!

Things did not go well with my father. I knew he was old but I still did not expect...He has left this mortal world and gone to meet my mother in the elven afterlife. He told me that he shall await me there, when I am finally ready to join them, that perhaps I shall finally have the patience and perspective that he believes I so obviously lack now. He is hoping that I will settle down now and become a mage to please him, perhaps out of loyalty or guilt. Part of me feels as though I should be a dutiful son and carry on the family legacy, but I know in my heart that it is wrong. I do not have the skill or patience for the arts of magic, I do not like to sit and study a book when the wind is calling to me from outside. I have decided that it is time to leave now, quietly, before the council can officially rule that I must stay here as a captive forever. I do intend on returning eventually, but not until things have calmed down and the council has grown a little more accepting of the younger generations that are slowly coming to power here. I plan to follow the wind wherever it takes me, and perhaps to learn more of the goddess Akadi that I have heard so much of during my journies. There is supposed to be a temple of hers somewhere along the road through the Antioch Mountains. Maybe the winds will lead me there.
