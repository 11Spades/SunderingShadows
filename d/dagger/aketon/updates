Okay this file is the up to date of the progress of the Aketon city.

Please refer to it if you need the most up to date information.

The basic plan of the city is done now. I am working on all the room
connections now, so all the rooms will be here but just empty rooms.
I will start doing the detailed stuff once I finished all the room
connections and upload to the mud.
There will be 5 trees: tree1, tree2 ... tree5, tree1 is the main one.
You can reach from the path to tree1, 2 and 3, but not the 4 and 5.
They can be accessed via 1.
--Mud time, 28/2/98.

All the basic city rooms are uploaded to the mud. They are just simple
rooms with proper connections. I will modify them to function rooms now.
--Mud time, 1/3/98.

The bank (1one47), church (1one20) and treasury (1one32) is in.
Working on the Aketon Revenue now.
--Mud time, 2/3/98.

The Revenue Bureau (1one35) and those rooms connecting to them are done
and uploaded to the mud. The saved list will be of future use in the city.
--Mud time, 3/3/98.

The Longsword of assassins is tested and should be okay to use. It will
be possessed by an elf assassin who wanders in the city to kill any player
of human race. The name of that assassin is Portus the assassin. Check out
~aketon/obj/asssword.c for the sword. Portus will be in ~aketon/mon/portus.c
--Mud time, 5/3/98.

Armoury (1one51), Weapon Shop (1one16), General Store (1one62) and Healer
(1one5) are in. Healer is one of the places that benefits citizens of this
city and disgrace humans (make use of the Aketon citizen list).
--Mud time, 6/3/98.

Archery (1one56) is in. There are some new bows, just some simple ones.
--Mud time, 10/3/98.

The inheritable file ~aketon/path/inherit.c which will load random livings in
the city is uploaded to the mud. There are 6 types of citizens and a few types
of guards or patrols of the city.
--Mud time, 12/3/98.

Modified inherit.c and relocated it to ~aketon/rooms/. Tested some rooms
with inherit.c. The monster frequencey is relative high, should be proper for
a large city (a prosperous city). Some rooms connecting to the done rooms are
also done and uploaded (1one13,17,28,33,34,39,48,50,54).
--Mud time, 13/3/98.

Aketon Exotic Mounts (1one11) is in. It sell hippogriffs usable only by elves.
--Mud time, 15/3/98.

Sparrow Inn (1one31), Crossroad Bar (1one36) and Stable (1one42) are in.
The stable sells horse, war horse as well as heavy warhorse.
--Mud time, 16/3/98.

Archers who will be asigned to guard the city are done. ~mon/archer.c
--Mud time, 18/3/98.

Whitedoll Hotel (1one55) done.
--Mud time, 19/3/98.

Alchemy, a component shop (1one12) and Spell Shop (1one25) is done. The Spell
Shop owner Wizolyx (~mon/wizolyx.c) is a good monster to fight on.
--Mud time, 20/3/98.

Jewellery (1one4) and Tobacco Shop (1one24) finished. Ornaments sold in the
jewellery have a low chance of getting some specialities (ac, stats ...).
--Mud time, 21/3/98.

The Garment Outlet (1one43) done. It sells clothings which have a very low
chance of getting some ac (1 to 3), but the first one who pick it up (buy)
must be elf and the chances are low. 1/100, 1/200, 1/300.
--Mud time, 22/3/98.

The local Tailor (1one63) is done. The shopkeeper will make you some good
quality suits if you ever need them. All the clothing gives no ac bonus.
--Mud time, 28/3/98.

Fixed problems with buying things at the tailor. It is working fine now.
--Mud time, 29/3/98.

citizenA to F, guardA to C done. They just added some variety to this big
city, some flying colour. The frequency of monster appearing is quite high
but it should be okay. If I found it's too high, i will adjust it in the
inherit.c. Will do next all the outdoor rooms in tree1 level 1 as well as
those rooms assigned to city guards at level 1 (1oneXX rooms).
--Mud time, 30/3/98.

The main roads in level 1 are done. guardD (standing guard who will be assigned
to positions which stops all non-citizens) and E (gate guard who guards all the
gates of Aketon) done. D is f/c/m. Next will add the guard posts of level 1 of
tree1.
--Mud time, 31/3/98.

The guard posts (1one3,6,15,59,64,61,52,9) together with guardF the post guard
are done and uploaded. I've put a board in ~aketon/path/path11 which is the
entrance to the whole city. Anyone are encouraged to post stuffs there, ideas
or so so ... Well the level 1 of tree1 is finally all done. *grin* This is slow
:) very slow :P
--Mud time, 1/4/98.

The second level of tree1 is all done, 4 unique monsters are added there. And
quite a number of different kinds of soldiers are added into the area. The
files are all under ..aketon/mon/
The unique ones are, rotatia.c goginet.c lugabet.c aerotia.c, the others are
archer.c cavalry.c infantry.c scout.c together with guardA to F which was
added earlier and the citizen files.
--Mud time, 6/4/98.

Have lots of players and my test character tested the first two levels of the
tree1. Looks like it's working properly so far. I'm going to have exam. very
soon. I will not be availbe here to code up the reset stuffs. I will try to
be back on track as soonn as possible. That's the plan so far.
--Mud time, 14/4/98.

Okay I've working on it again. Naxterr the mayor done with club of disruption
and the cloak of elven kind. (obj/club_disrup.c obj/cloak_elven.c mon/naxterr.c)
And now I have to leave for 20 days. I'll be back and code the rest up as soon
as possible.
--Mud time, 23/5/98.

Umm... this took too long. The Mayor quarter (1fiveX) all done and added some
artifacts into the area. Also the elders coded up (chelspan and shawdor). Will
be working on the Elder quarter (1threeX) and the council area (1fourX) real soon.
--Mud time, 23/7/98.

Almost a month!? Damn it, I'm not so productive these days. Okay, made some very
evil bracers of defenselessness, silver necklace of strangulation, some other
weapons for chelspan and shawdor. Fixed the apparent problems with the artifacts
and will add avatar ideas to the city. Working on the elder quarter (1threeX)
which was lost due to a crash a while back.
--Mud time, 13/8/98.

Well, got the mood back to do something about this place again. I think this time
I have finally finished everything about tree1. Including all the rooms, citizens,
guards, military chiefs, city elders, councilors, naxterr the mayor and the to-be
used assassin_d.c the assassin controlling daemon. Also Teleris is done. I think
I will change the way artifact is controlled now. I don't like the complexity of
that system at all. I will change the system to a daemon controlling artifact
system later when I have a clear straight mind ready. Ohh the sliding cable
system of aketon is basically set up already. All existing monsters are mobilized
with set_speed() and are not allowed to leave particular rooms with exit functions
set up in designated rooms accordingly.
--Mud time, 29/6/99.
