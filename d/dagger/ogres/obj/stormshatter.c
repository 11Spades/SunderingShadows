This massive bow seems to be out of a single large bone from some sort of animal. The bone has 
been strenghened by sinews tanned and wrapped around it tightly. The tip of the bow has been
sharpened into an almost crude spear with jagged sides. The bow almost seems to radiate power and
there is a distict smell of ozone in the area. Small crude native images have been cut into the
bone showing a massive storm that is destroying a village with lightning, winds and rain. The
strong bowstring is made out of twisted aninal sinews, and you can only image what strength it
takes to draw the bow.\n");
