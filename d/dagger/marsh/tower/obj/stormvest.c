The Vest of the Storms, many believe to be Talosian in desing and origin.  When in truth Talos and his faithful had little to do with its creation.  The vest is attributed to a sorceress by the name of Ororo, who was known as the Weather Witch.  The Weather Witch favored spells that delt with lighting, wind, and other meterlogical effects thus how she earned her nickname.  This vest is one of the last items of hers to be in existance in the lands, so it is rumored.
