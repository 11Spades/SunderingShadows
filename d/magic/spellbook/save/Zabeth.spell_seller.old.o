Her creamy white skin has become wrinkled with age and is rather thin, giving it the look of white parchment.  Though not an overly handsome woman, she is saved from being plain by high, graceful cheekbones and warm chestnut brown eyes.  Her dark brown hair is streaked with gray and pulled back into a bun at the base of her neck, though escaped tendrils of hair ring her face and soften her appearance.  She seems to love her work and is never found without a book in her hand and a small ink smudge on her cheek. %^RESET%^<help shop> will get you a list of shop commands.","short":"Zabeth, the mystical scribe","adreniline":0,"condition":100,"race":"human","id":({"zabeth","clerk","shop keeper","shopkeeper",}),"max staff":120,"aggressive":0,"last say":"I will have your spell book copied in twenty minutes.
