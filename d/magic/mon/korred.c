	This small creature has a dwarflike stout body and short goatlike
legs.  The remarkable thing about this creature is its hair.  The hair 
looks more massive than the creature itself and is without a doubt much
bigger.  Used to a life of love and dancing and fun, you realize that this 
creature is fully capable of battle simply by the way it leans on its staff.
