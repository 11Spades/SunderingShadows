This is a small cottage, made of wood from what you can tell.  
Even as you watch, it wavers as though through steam or intense 
heat, or as though it were not entirely real.  Still, it would 
likely offer some shelter from threats in the surrounding area.  
You could likely <access cottage> to go inside and investigate.  
If you are the one who created the portal, you may also <dismiss
