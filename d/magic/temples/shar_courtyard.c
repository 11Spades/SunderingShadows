%^BOLD%^NOTE:%^RESET%^ Nightfall has requested that the fruit be a poison that can be applied to weapons as well.  No decision has been reached yet, so I'm leaving this here for future reference in case it does go in.

apply fruit to weapon: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^You deftly swipe the fruit across your blade coating it thoroughly in the oily black sap.%^RESET%^

Others see: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^(Whoever) deftly swipes the fruit across the surface of his/her blade, coating it thoroughly in the oily black sap.%^RESET%^
