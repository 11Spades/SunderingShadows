Strive to live in harmony with the wilds, for we are each part of the eternal cycle.  Seek to perceive the greater balance in all things, and do not fear the forces of nature, for where destruction, decay and death clear a passage, life springs forth anew.  Intervene where you must, whether it be to cull or to plant anew.  Work actively against those who would disturb the natural order, and teach the ways of the wilderness to any who will listen.  Though civilisations may rise and fall, in the end nature will always reclaim its own.
