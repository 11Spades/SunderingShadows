%^BOLD%^Lord Shadow charges his followers with this message:%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^
The world is filled with darkness, fear and suffering - the only separation is between the powerful who wield these gifts, and the powerless who cower before them.  Hope is merely a temporary shelter for the weak, for as each day inevitably ends beneath the cloak of night, so will all things inevitably succumb to darkness.  Submit to the word of Lord Shadow and his ranking clergy, for true power can only be gained through unwavering loyalty.  Spread His fear across the realm, and strike down those who would defy His will, so that all may come to know servitude in His name.
