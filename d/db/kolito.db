|emote signs to $N in an understanding manner+|speech whisper in a soft, peaceful voice+Curses can be occasionally found on arms and armor, placed by a vindictive wizard, or maybe a missed casting, or perhaps a god deemed that piece of equipment be fraught with disaster and suffering following it.+|emote looks toward $N and shakes her head+@smile+The church and temples in the land can identify such gear, for a small fee of course+The fee is greater, as is the effort if you happen to be wielding a weapon that is indeed cursed... It may actually require more than one session to remove it.+|speech

|speech whisper in a soft, peaceful voice+If you are a cleric, and have lost your holy symbol, you can request another here, but the pain you will feel will be symbolic of the pain your chosen god or goddess feels that you lost the symbol of your faith.+|emote sighs slightly, but continues on a happier note.+You may as well wish to stop by downstairs in the hall, as many matters common to all clerical classes are discussed there, and it is another place to pray to your chosen god or goddess in addition to the temple in the realms that other worshippers have formed.+
|speech whisper in a soft, peaceful voice+Temples are another place to show your worship and love for your deity.  You may even wish to donate items to show your faith, atone, or speak with others of the faith at the appropriate temple.+|smile+It is also not unheard of for people to leave offerings at other temples as well, especially if the god holds power over the situation that concerns you, dear adventurer.  For example, before traveling through a forest, one might plant a tree for Nim'navnon, while for a safe passage over the oceans, you might wish to praise Lysara or appease Khyron so no storms may find you.

$frowns in distaste+|speech say in a displeased whisper+Undead can be a vile, wicked menace. Created by evil and with evil intent in mind, the bodies of the deceased have no rest because of greed and lust for power.+$frowns+Clerics can turn them away or blast them into dust if they get powerful enough. For the young cleric in a party there is holy water in the basement, so he can give it to his allies if they can sling it at undead to help destroy them.+|speech
