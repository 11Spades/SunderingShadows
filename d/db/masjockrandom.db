$shakes his head in disgust and sighs.+No no no.  Keep yer head up ya bloody fool.  Donna watch my feet lad.+?class != fighter+^OCK!  Canna anyone fight around here?+I'd give my last eye-tooth for a good bar-room brawl right about now!+?+?class == mage+$spins his weapon around quickly, confusing you for a few seconds.+You magely types aren't that much of a challenge until you get your hands into those little bags of yours.+?
Sure, sure, ya see a fighter smash a critter flat once and think it's great.  It's called rush for a reason.+|speech smirk and says+Ever see one of 'em fall flat on their face in all that armor?+|speech
Yah, fighters parry blows too.+When they set up in a defensive mode though, they won't be runnin' outta the room fer a while since they're busy parryin'.+&smirk
|speech ask+Ya see them thieves stab an' scramble?+|speech+Might wanna watch yer back regular when there's one around.  O' course ya might never know 'til they got a dagger in yer back already.
If you wanna learn ta shoot a bow, go shoot the targets in the archery range and donna forget the arrows.+If ya wanna practice with it like a club, we can do that here.+&smirk
Come on now.  Donna get discouraged yet!+This takes time, but ya DO wanna learn to use that weapon before ya go fightin' somethin' that'll actually try ta kill you right?
|speech look amused and says+No, I won't kill ya, but you'll get a little beat up.  Better than beatin' yourself up with yer own weapon though.+&smirk and chuckles+I'll stop and let ya take a break when ya get too hurt.+Then you'll need ta try ta heal yourself or get kits from the healer.+|speech
^Wake up there and PAY ATTENTION kid!!+$slaps you on the back and laughs after he has your attention.+|speech say more seriously+This may seem boring but it could save yer life some day.+|speech
$slips behind you and taps you on the back.++^Forgot ta WATCH yer back didn't ya!!+$nearly drops his sword as he laughs.+Scared ya I hope.  Best way ta keep from getting stabbed is ta keep yer guard up with watch so maybe that'll help ya remember!
The weapons store clerk can probably tell ya more about weapon types.  'Course ya can check the skillneeded for the weapon if ya have it ta find out what ya need ta train for.
Proficiencies, profs, those determine how many different weapon types ya can learn well.  Ya can't all be like fighter types an' learn anythin' ya pick up well.+Paladins and rangers wanna avoid them evil weapons too ya know.
