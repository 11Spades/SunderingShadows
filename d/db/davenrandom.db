$moves a few short swords and daggers to a bottom rack.+Let's put these down where the little people can see them since they need small weapons if they want to use a shield or two weapons.
@eye+Well, if you're not a ranger, you might want to see the armorer about shield or buy a small weapon for your right hand.+Normal size folks who don't use a shield need a small second weapon or they'll fumble them both.++Only rangers get the training to dual-wield full size weapons effectively and not drop them.
Surely you know the gods or goddesses that bless rangers and other goodly folk would feel betrayed if they helped savages such as goblins, drow, gnolls, ogres, orcs, and other evil ilk.+Rangers are supposed to protect the forests and other good things from all evil because even evil in the cities will soon spread to their domain.
|speech suggest+Don't forget to visit the trainer each time you decide to learn a new weapon too.  Mortius is the one here in Offestry and Masjock set up his shop in Shadow along the main street.+|speech+Training in weapons seems even more popular than learning languages.
|speech suggest+If your parents taught you a weapon type you still enjoy using, you might want to start out with a weapon in that family.+ For instance, morning stars are in the mace family.+You can find out the skillneeded for a weapon easily enough if you learn about profs or proficiencies.+|speech
|speech look up and says+I'll show you anything on the list there if you just let me know which catch your fancy.+Of course you can just buy it and sell it back if you don't like it, but naturally I can't pay as much once you've handled it.+|speech
When you get strong and brave enough to venture out to Shadow, you may want to look up Valchor and tell him I sent you.+You'll probably be finding magical stuff in your adventures, but he'll buy the normal weapons you find too.+His shop's in the north and east of Shadow but the town crier or scribe there sells maps if you need it.+&smile as he polishes a sword.
|speech say with a look of concern+You don't want to see what drow do with blades.  Often the first sign of a drow is a dagger in your back.+Even if they seem harmless or even friendly when you meet them, don't let that fool you.  They'll double cross anyone sooner or later, including their own family and the half-drow are just as bad.  Seems to be something in the blood.+Of course that's the case with any sort of evil.+|speech
|speech smirk and says+$looks over at a customer trying to wield a shield and rolls his eyes+You know, you CAN wield about anything but so what?+You need to wear the shield for instance instead of trying to use it like a weapon.+It takes real weapons that you have trained with to do damage.+|speech
$looks around the shop and nods to his customers+|speech whisper mysteriously+I used to work down in the mines a long time ago. Back when I was a boy was decent work and paid well enough. You always got to keep what you mined+Don't get me wrong, it was a hard job, and I've seen alot of people pass out doing it, or some even get hurt, but it was well worth it, espicially if you are short on gold+$shrugs and goes back to work arranged items on the racks+|speech
