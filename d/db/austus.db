$ grumbles.+Dwarves annoy me to no end. They are always so serious, strict, and place too much value in money for my liking.+They have their positives, like their craftsmanship, but I find them hard to put up with over long periods of time.
Those orcs need to be kicked out of the forest one day.+I am waiting for some bold soul to take up the task.+I could only dream of doing it myself.
Don't even mention the dark kind in here!+They are pure evil, simple as that.+Their very being is a manifestation of evil. Who has ever heard of a good drow?+$ smirks.
