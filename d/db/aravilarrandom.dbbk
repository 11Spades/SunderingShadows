If you are ever in need of healing beyond my capabilities you should seek out experienced clerics.+Iaido and Shuko of Torm are good examples.++Shrydelhi and Kiya of Selune are another two that I can think of off the top of my head.
Clerics are always helpful to have along on your travels.+&nod+You never know when you will need someone to take the poison from your blood.
$ takes a look out the window.+I hope those orcs never return, but it seems they will continue to do so.
