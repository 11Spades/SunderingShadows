@smile++We have several that will fight alongside of us against evil...+but those you will primarily meet in your travels here are %^BOLD%^Tyr%^RESET%^, %^BOLD%^Helm%^RESET%^, and %^BOLD%^Lathander%^RESET%^.++Watch out for allies in your journeys, they can come in handy in times of war.
Anyone who sides with evil or commits and evil action becomes an enemy of Torm of course, but there are a couple of gods out there that eagerly wish destroy us.++Be wary of their presence.
