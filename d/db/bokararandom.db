&smile sadly+I miss my son....+$sighs softly
$shakes his head+I hear a few tailors been fighting over that thread...+$mumbles and goes back to work
&hmm+Well I heard someone mention the other day that my son followed some fellow named the Oak Father+&shrug+I don't know how true that is though
$looks around and grins proudly+My son and his friends Schatten and Kaarell, searched around up north and found that eligorian weed they were looking for.+Thankfully they were able to cure Mallido... my son said it's cause the blessing of the forest father was with them, not really sure what he means by that though.+&shrug
$looks around at his customers and smiles+If you want one of these items, you better hurry up and buy them!+There is a profitable market for them, and I aint going to hold any of them back for you.+$grins
$grins proudly+My son has went out on another mission, left a few weeks back. Hear he's going to fight the biggest dragon ever saw in the South...+The dragon should have moved out of there years back+$grins
Business has been pretty good lately.. but I am hoping when my son gets back he will bring me some more of that Golden Thread+$grins+That thread is profitable, seems like every tailor around is looking for it..+Only thing is I promised the next of it to the master weaver Akanar over in Seneca.+&shrug+I am sure he will pay alot for it, at least enough to put to shame any other offers.. and he is the best tailor around, not to mention helped schatten and kaarell alot with their wedding garb.
