$ nods and frowns.+The trails north of Kildare Glen were once pleasant and safe for our people.  We foraged for food there, and there our children played.+$ shakes his head slowly.+Now the perytons have taken over, and we can no longer venture far from the village.  Some of our people are even too frightened to leave their homes.
$ sighs deeply.+Aye...tis true, I'm afraid.  These demonic beasts eat the hearts of those who cannot escape them.  They seem interested in only humans or those of similar form.++Legend has it that they hate all life and believe they can escape this world by consuming the perfect heart.  I vow to make them leave this world by the might of my mace instead.
The peryton's shadow is the most disturbing...even more so than the sight of a twisted stag's head on an eagle's body.  That's unnatural, that is.  But casting the shadow of a man...+$ shakes his head and narrows his eyes.++That is purely demonic.
Never has there been a beast more foul than the dread peryton!+$ growls and his eyes darken.++A twisted creation...it surely cannot exist in nature!  A giant green eagle with the head of a black stag.  Antlers that twist and turn, glittering black as the abyss itself.  Horrible fangs and empty red eyes that glow with the fires of hell.  Their claws tear flesh, and they can rip the heart right out of a full-grown man as he stands.+$ sighs and shakes his head, glancing down at his hands.++Fell beasts...beware them.
$ smiles briefly and nods.+Aye...faith is very important in life.  I help the villagers understand the world around us.  We make offerings to many deities and in turn we receive blessings if we are worthy.+We appease Auril during the harsh winters and praise Lathander for the rising sun each morn.  Each villager's individual dedication to a deity, though...that is his or her own decision.  I merely offer insight along the way.
