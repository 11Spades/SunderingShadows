$kneels at the altar and whispers a prayer.+Lord Kelemvor, please give us and these visitors the strength and wisdom to send all undead to their final rest with you.
I am pleased to see visitors to my lord Kelemvor's temple.+Many seem to misunderstand and believe we bring death.+Instead, we are simply guides and provide comfort to the natural process or to those left behind by one who has passed.
$lights a candle at the altar.+|speech whisper a somber prayer+May the souls of those who have passed be at rest and those who live honor their memories.+|speech
Some misunderstand the spell our clerical followers use that seems to raise corpses to be undead.+In truth, it releases their souls to Kelemvor's hand and only brings the lifeless empty husks to serve to protect the cleric.+It is quite different than the common spell of animate dead, which does trap the souls and create undead beings from the corpses.
