$ raises his left eyebrow.+You wanna know how I got this, hmm?+$ grins and gestures to the eye patch covering his right eye.+You ever hear of that emerald dragon about?  No?  Well, anyhow...I snuck into his lair, see, and I was creepin' forward...ever so slowly...+$ lowers his voice as he continues, almost whispering.+I was reaching for this huge gem in his horde...monstrous thing it is.  I wrapped my hand around it and high-tailed it out of there.  All was well until...++I was climbing down the mountainside and then...SCREECH!!  Here he comes, flying down out of the sky!  Crazy dragon...+$ chuckles and shakes his head.+Quite a fight that was.  We battled it out...in the end, he took my eye, I took his gem.  But I left him with something to think about.  Seems like a fair trade.+$ winks.+Sellin' that gem gave me enough to start this fence and retire...permanently.
