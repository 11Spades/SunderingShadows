You may think full plate is expensive, but it is a LOT of work to make all those pieces fit to you and fitted together well.+Good workable metal isn't cheap either.+Count yourself lucky you don't have to come back for several fittings.  The staff to fit it so quickly is expensive too you know?+$turns to an apprentice and shows him how to adjust the fit of a breastplate to shoulderplates.
&chuckle and looks you over+Don't forget basic things like a cloak, robe, and boots of some sort too.  Some of them provide protection in battle as well as from the elements.+If I don't have what you need you might try a clothing shop or find something on the creatures you'll fight in your adventures.
Cloaks are worn around the neck, so you'll find you'll need to remove most necklaces or neck chains to wear them.
Oh, don't come complaining if this non-magical stuff gets worn out on you.+You'll need to adventure and find magical gear if you want something that lasts nearly forever.
You might want a shield or helm too.  Although... of course the sneaky types won't and mages need clear heads and free hands to cast their spells.+&smirk
$turns to an apprentice just arriving.+Don't forget to tell customers there are actually several types of plate armor.+This suit of full plate here is the most popular, and most expensive but show them how impressive it is to behold.+$points to a suit of full plate nearly assembled.+Then there's field plate, plate mail, and bronze plate.+All these are heavy, cumbersome, and noisy but show them how they protect every area except the head and extremities.+#Every now and again some silly thief-type buys plate armor.  What a riot to see them try to wear it.+&snicker
|speech look hopeful and says+So, are you buying or selling today? +Sure seems like everyone wants to sell and so few one want to buy.  We have families to feed you know.+|speech+@smile
|speech smirk and says+Of COURSE I don't sell plate armors to just anyone who thinks they might want to be an adventurer.  They all need some practice with fighting with real weapons and armor first.+&roll+Besides, I don't want MY customers falling down and flailing around like a beached whale until someone helps them up because they don't have the practice to handle themselves in plate yet.+&chuckle to himself and goes back to straightening up+|speech
Don't try to wield and fight with a shield unless you're desperate.+Never seen anybody but those toll booth guards north of that cornfield learn to do any damage with one.  They're good with them though.+$rubs his kneecap and smirks.+Shields are meant to be worn.
Some warriors, knights especially, find a smithy to make their shields small pieces of art, often decorating then with their crests or banners of their families, respective orders, or dieties.
