$ pauses for a moment and squints, wrinkling her nose.+The halflings, the halflings...oh, you'll be meaning about the cave, right?+$ nods and draws up to her full height, looking the part of professor.+Yes, well, the halflings...there was a small band of them, oh, about twenty years ago.  They found some caves near here and what they found was so disturbing that when they returned, all they would say was "ekibi", which you - I have no doubt - know means "bad" in their language.+That group never went back, but one of their number reported their findings to my League - the Gnomish Explorers' League, of course.+$ smiles with a hint of pride, adjusting her %^MAGENTA%^violet-colored goggles%^RESET%^.+The League has sent me out here to discover the truth.
The Ekibi Caverns get their name from the halflings who first discovered them.  They're filled with all sorts of monstrous insects!+$ nods quickly.+They've grown into giants, you see, and I think I know why.  There's a stone down there, faerzress, the drow call it...anyway, I think it's the source.  That's why I'm doing all these experiements here.+The caverns are just northeast of here, if you have a hankering to go looking.  Hey, if you do, bring me back a sample of faerzress, will you?+$ returns to her work.

Faerzress stone?+$ pauses a moment and adjusts her %^MAGENTA%^violet-colored goggles%^RESET%^.+Well, it's a drow name, really, but it's becoming more common now.  It's a purplish stone that seems to glow...it's caused all sorts of havoc in the underdark.+I think it's in these caverns.  Oh, probably in small amounts, mind you, but there nonetheless.+That's why the insects in the Ekibi Caverns get so big.+$ nods resolutely.
