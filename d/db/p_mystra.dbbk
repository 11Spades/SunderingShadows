@look+|speech speak in a magically inquisitive tone+Did I hear you speaking of scrolls?+$sets his book back on the bookcase and walks towards you.+|speech look into your eyes while speaking+Scrolls come from many places across the lands.+Some full of danger, others full of enlightenment.++$crosses his right leg across his left and puts his toes to the floor while crossing his arms.+Each scroll, depending on your accuracy in translation, will hold spells of offense, as well as defense. Others still merely exist to aid you on your journeys.+|speech carrie his tone down to the floor with his eyes+Just remember the charge of Mystra, and do your best to honor it always. For it is she that gave you the gift you possess as a mage in the realm of Shadow.+$goes back to the bookshelf and grabs his book.+$opens his book and picks up his studies where he left off.+|speech
So you wish to know a little of Mystra do you?+$puts a book away and steps forward in your direction.+|speech look at you inquisitively+What is it your wishing to know?+|speech talk almost like he is preaching+There are many different things to be known about the %^BOLD%^clergy%^RESET%^ of Mystra.  Everything from %^BOLD%^scrolls%^RESET%^ and %^BOLD%^spells%^RESET%^ to information on the %^BOLD%^duty%^RESET%^ of a priest or priestess and our own %^BOLD%^holy%^RESET%^ days.  Feel free to ask me about whatever topics you like.+$walks over to the bookcase and picks up another book to study.+$sits down and starts to read.
$lays his book on the pew beside him and turns back, laying his arm over the backrest.+|speech speak with a magical tone+All wielders of magic and seekers after arcane lore of any race are welcome in the service of Mystra.+$repositions himself in his seat to get turned around further for a better view.+@smile+Of course, any followers that believe they can betray the charge of Mystra will come into a very nasty surprise.+$turns back around and gets comfortable.+$picks up his book and returns to his studies.
|speech say like he's said it thousands of times+I wondered when you would get around to asking that. Everyone does sooner or later, usually sooner I might add.+&chuckle+$stands up, leaving his book at his seat.+|speech speak with reassuring knowledge+As I have said before, the scrolls which carry spells in their scribings are of many different varieties.+$stops for a moment to take a drink of water from his pail.+$looks up, wipes his mouth, and continues talking.+Some of the less...humbles, shall we say...magi, feel that their power and magic comes from spells they themselves have created and scribed down.+&sigh+This is not the case at all.  Magic is an art yes, but it is also a gift from the lady of magic, Mystra.  Spells come from the Weave that she resides over.  And those that wield her gift, are priviledged souls. Remain humble of your gift, if you possess it, and don't let your ego take over.+@smile with approval of your inquisitivness+I must get back to my studies now.+$walks back to his book and picks it up.+$opens his book back up and thumbs to the proper page while seating himself+|speech
|speech speak seriously+$stands once again, but with a serious look upon his face.+The duties of a priest of priestess of Mystra are not a joke.+Much work is expected of our clergy.+$walks towards you, carrying the book with him and guarding it closely.+We strive with our lives, to preserve magic.  To make it last through the test of time.  To do this, we must keep the faith alive by spreading the words of Mystra and letting others know that it is she that keeps the weave, and maintains our gift.  Another way to keep the faith is by keeping the lore of magic safe.  We do this in libraries, our own private books, and in our laboratories.+We seek to keep a watchful eye on those that are learned to be skilled magi.  Magic will not survive, if a renegade magi makes a bad name for the temple of Mystra, or the sake of magic.  We watch their behavior, and try very hard to keep down bad results from the use of the weave.+$takes a deep breath and continues.+We also push our clergy and our followers, to pursue the creation of new magic when of appropriate strength in the church.  We do this to keep the study of magic a growing art, to keep magic a thing of wonder, and to honor the lady.+Expect to be held accountable for these duties, if you be in the service of Mystra, read her charge and follow it to the letter, and of course...remember to offer her a prayer of thanks daily to sustain her strength.+$nods to you solemnly and goes over to the altar.+$kneels before the altar and mutters a prayer to Mystra.+++$stands, turns back to you and smiles, than returns to the nearest pew to study some more.
|speech+$gets a whimsical look upon his face.+$continues reading while speaking.+I can tell you right now, Mystra has little need for holy days.  Offer her a prayer of thanks for the gifts that she grants you, and you do more for her than you can imagine.++However...+$stands up and puts his book aside for a moment.+Mystra also realizes the need of some people for a organized celebration.+In that view the church of Mystra here in Shadow, offers the 16th of the month of Sundays as a time of special rejoicing.  In celebration of Mystra's venture into this realm.  It is a time for all followers and believers in Mystra to gather in rejoice of the weave, and is usually succeeded by a showing of magical fireworks at the days end.+#When we can afford them of course.+@wink+$picks his book back up and reads into it some more as he sits.
|speech raise his voice+^Don't ever speak of such things in this sacred place!+$takes a moment to catch his breath.++|speech speak calmer+I apologize, but those who know the church of Mystra knows that she is about creation, not destruction in any way.+|speech
