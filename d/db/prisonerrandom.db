I hate this dreaded place!
The wolves, and the trolls, they are unbearable, have mercy!
Please, GODS, have mercy on me!
May doom come to this place, may destruction take it swiftly!
Gods, what have I done to deserve this??  Have mercy!
Please, put me out of my misery.... 
My wounds, they are all infected!  Please, have mercy!
The beasts responsible must pay, they must be slain!
All shall end in enslavement!
There shall be no rest for any, have mercy!
When shall it all end?  MAY THE GODS HAVE MERCY!
Forgive me, great GODS and show mercy!
We are trapped, we are all trapped!  HELP!  Please HELP US!
