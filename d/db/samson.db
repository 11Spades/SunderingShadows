|say The sheep?  We're not really sure what is wrong with some of them.  They seem to be getting sicker by the day.  But we don't know why.+|emote shakes his head sadly.+|say It has only been a few so far, and the herders have put them down.  That's good, we don't want whatever this is to keep spreading.
|say Yes I treat the sick and injured.  People mostly, but seems more and more I'm treating animals!+|emote sighs deeply.+|say I've had to instruct them to put the sick sheep down.  I think we got them all, but we're keeping an eye on them.
|emote glances over at his tools of the trade.+|say I'm a healer.  That's my job, not a murderer.+|say Man or animal, I hate seeing any of them die.  And lately I've seen too much.+|emote grows quiet, his eyes looking at something distant and unseen.+|say Yes too much.  Those poor sheep.
