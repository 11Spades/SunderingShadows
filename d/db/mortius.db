|speech smirk and says+Thieves of course want to learn to sneak up on their opponents and stab since they can't wear much armor.  So, hiding and moving quietly are important of course and you need to be careful about how much and what sort of armor you wear.+@eye++|speech+It's most effective to open battle with a stab if you dare, but remember you won't be able to get away from them for a little while after because you'll be too busy.++$demonstrates a blocking move.+If you're going to stay in battle though, you can scramble too.
|speech smirk and says+Rogue is just a fancy and colorful word for thief ya know.  Some have more style than others, but it's the same end result.+|speech
Scrambling will help you dodge of course.  Sometimes it will even give you a chance to get behind your opponent and stab again.  Give it your best shot if you want.+$pauses and sets up to defend himself again.+|speech smirk and says+I promise I'll still give you a break if you get too badly hurt too.+&grin+|speech
Fighters of course learn to rush at their opponents and sometimes do massive damage or at least knock the wind out if they manage to hit.+Of course if they miss and run into a wall or fall on their face, they don't get right back into battle.
If you want to learn to shoot a bow, you'll need arrows or bolts of course and go shoot at the targets in the archery range in the next room.+If you want to practice with it like a club so when whatever you shot comes after you, we can do that right here.+&smirk
Profs or proficiencies, those determine how many different weapon types you can learn to use effectively.+?class == cleric+Of course you know clerics don't have as much need for combat with weapons.  Even if you're training as a fighter too you won't have any more profs, so choose wisely.  Mace types or staves are most popular of course but some use other clublike weapons.+?+?class == fighter+If you are a fighter with no other training, I can help you learn to do up to twice as much damage as normal with your preferred weapon.+It's called specialization but you'll have to spend most of your training with that one weapon.+?+?class == bard+Yep, bards can learn a pretty wide variety of weapons.  They don't have any particular strong suits in combat but since they have some basic fighter training and some skills of a rogue they can use about any weapon.+?+?class == cavalier+Of course as a knightly type you'll want to train fully in lance since you'll be able to get better and better with experience.+You'll find your skill with medium blades eventually gets better than most except fighters too.+@eye+|speech caution+Just watch your back and that code of yours.  Not many can live up to that code, especially once they find out that shiny armor that impresses the ladies also makes them such a prime target for the evil ones.+$shakes his head sadly.+|speech+?
We fighters of course get the most training in melee combat.  We learn to rush, flash, and parry which are all handy skills for hand to hand combat.+Better yet, if a single-class fighter concentrates their training, we can learn to do far more damage than most with those weapons.
Flash is a quick move fighters learn.+&grin and winks slyly+Sometimes it allows you to get in a kick to the chest or knee or other vital part that can take an opponent by surprise and do some extra damage.  It's very difficult to succeed at one, but if you keep trying sooner or later you'll land one.+$demonstrates by stepping back and popping his foot out against your kneecap but stops just short of hitting.
Of course you know clerics don't have as much need for combat with weapons since their gods give them all those spells.  Even training as a fighter too they don't have the proficiency in weapon variety.  Mace types or staves are most popular of course but some use clublike weapons.

|speech look amused and says reassuringly+No, I won't kill you although you'll get bruised up in the process.  Better to train here than beat yourself up with your own weapon though isn't it?+&smirk and chuckles+I'll stop and let you take a break to heal when you get too badly hurt.+|speech remind you+Then you'll need to try to heal yourself or go get kits from the healer.+|speech

Knights learn to use those lances very well and get better over time too.  Figures since they spend most of their time on horseback and learned early on in those jousting tournaments.+|speech smirk and says+Ever see one of them charge from a few rooms away?  I've seen many a seasoned warrior run when they see that lance aimed at their head and the horse bearing down on them.+|speech+They get very good with swords and can even parry.

If you're a knightly type of course you'll want to practice your lance regularly.+|speech smirk and says+Practice that charging too.   I've seen many a seasoned warrior run when they see a lance aimed at their head with a tin can riding a horse behind it bearing down on them at speed.+|speech
If you want to learn to shoot a bow, go shoot at the targets in the archery range in the next room.  Don't forget the arrows or bolts and to wield it too.+If you want to practice with it like a club so when whatever you shoot comes after you, we can do that right here.+&smirk
Knightly types can charge their opponents from several rooms.  Of course they need to be on horseback and wielding their lance.+A knight can sic their horse on their enemies too and the horses become stronger in battle as the knight does.
Rangers learn spells eventually of course but not until long after they leave here.  I can't help with that anyway.+Mostly they are known for being able to wield two normal size weapons without fumbling them.  Can't be fully encumbered or wear anything more restrictive than studded leather and do that though.
Parry is a handy skill that fighters and knightly types including cavaliers learn.+$steps into a defensive stance to demonstrate+See, when I do that I'll be harder to hit.  Of course like many other things, you can't run when you're doing it.
Cavaliers, those snobs in training to be knights, see plenty of them but not many make it.+As for training though, they have skills like charge and parry.  Of course most of them are all stuffy and arrogant over their nobility or at best so lawful it'll make you gag.+&smirk
Bards being dabblers in various things don't learn the special skills of fighters or thieves and even have limits on the magic.+I've seen them use their influence to anger or calm or charm others though and their songs can sure make the adrenalin flow for a fight.  Pretty impressive at times, although I've seen folk take offense and go berserk instead of getting calmed.+&smirk+Their strength seems to have some useful basic ability for about any occassion and their influence for the ones who are good entertainers and become well known.
|speech grin mockingly and says+Well now, if you want to learn how to use your weapon why don't you attack and try to kill me? I'll give you a good lesson on how to use that weapon of yours.+No, I won't kill you although you'll get bruised up in the process, but better to train here than beat yourself up with your own weapon though, isn't it?+#Alot better to learn here than in the middle of a dangerous fight where it could cost you your life.+|emote motions for $N to attack him+|speech
