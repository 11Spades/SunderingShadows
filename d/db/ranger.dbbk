&sigh++Sadly, the forest I have watched over for years has slowly become overrun with horrid evils. Everything from orcs to undead.+As if the others were not enough, an even greater %^BOLD%^%^RED%^evil%^RESET%^ has made it way to my island.
&nod+Evil magi have invaded the once small town of Sanctuary with their undead, constructs, other devices.+&frown+They killed almost everyone and who they did not kill they probably took to their %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tower%^RESET%^.
The mages have a tower north of the ruins that is now Sanctuary.+They keep the main entrance sealed with magic, but there is another way in. A %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^secret%^RESET%^ way.
&nod+Yes, I have followed more than one to it. Under the town, they use a portal to gain entrance, but you need a special %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^ring%^RESET%^ to use the portal.+Once inside, the stones are the path to the way inside.
&nod+I have overheard the confident mages talking. I am certain it is rigged with plenty of traps and tricks. I even heard talk of a demonic assassin being summoned to deal with those who their master thinks they can not handle on their own. Who their master is unknown to me.
