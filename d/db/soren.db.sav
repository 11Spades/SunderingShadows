$ tilts her head slightly to the side and listens.+Who is there?++I am Soren...this village has been my home these many years.  A strange plague has come upon us of late.  If you would like, I can tell you our story.
$ tilts her head to the side and listens.+I can hear you there...what is your name?++I am Soren...this village has been my home these many years.  A strange plague has come upon us of late.  If you would like, I can tell you our story.
$ tiles her head slightly to the side and listens.+Is someone there?++What is your name?++I am Soren...this village has been my home these many years.  A strange plague has come upon us of late.  If you would like, I can tell you our story.
$ nods with a grim expression.+Our story...it's a tragic one.  It begins many, many years ago...++Back then, this village was peaceful.  My twin sister and I were raised here, in this home.  My parents were tanners, and we were well-respected...+$ sighs briefly and breathes laboriously before continuing.+I never had cause to believe things would be any different.  Our world never changed, and that was just how I liked it.  But that was before...+$ shakes her head, and her eyes grow dark.+When I was around twelve years old, my sister began to change.  Her beautiful golden hair darkened and grew dim.  The light in her eyes burned out...+She would spend days alone in the forest, when before she had always taken me with her.  One day, I followed her...and there I saw something I will never forget.+$ sucks air through her thin lips.++My beautiful sister...she was there with a strange man.  I had never seen anything like him before.  I guess he was a man...I still am not sure.  He was dressed in a cloak made of skins that covered every inch of him.  He had a knife over my sister and was asking her something...did she accept?  That was his question...+I tried to scream, but couldn't.  And as I rushed forward, I heard her voice, calm and clear.++$ shakes her head.+"I accept the Lord of the Hunt and will make him my all," were the words that pierced my heart on that day.+$ pauses and tilts her head, listening carefully.++Are you still there?  Did you want to hear more?
$ nods briefly, her face tightening a bit.+I will continue the story...only because I want to warn those who come after me.  She is still out there...I know this, even if no one believes me.++$ thinks a moment before sighing and continuing.+Anyway, that day, I lost my sister.  She ran off into the woods and became a beast that plaqued my mind.  I would catch glimpses of her at times, running wild in skins with blood streaked in her hair.  She was savage and cruel, sometimes catching townspeople and torturing them with a chilling chase up the mountain passes.++She never returned here again...and after a time, she was not seen anymore.  No one understood what happened to her, and no one believed my story.  You see, that beast...the one that chased down my townspeople, it looked nothing like her any longer.+$ grips the handles of her rocking chair and rocks slowly.++Would you like to know what I believe happened?
I think my sister changed further...she became something darker.  Even though we never saw her here again.  I can feel her, still living.  She is no longer my sister as she was, but our bond is not broken.++A few decades after she vanished, the perytons descended upon us.  Born hunters, they are...made by a twisted deity who no longer exists himself.  But his creations do...they have no hope, no real life.  And so, they hunt down humans for their heart...trying to steal their lives.+$ nods slowly but decisively.+These hunters never found us before, and I think it is too strong a coincidence that they were led here after my sister joined the dark god of the hunt himself.  She brought them here.+$ sighs and rocks her chair slowly.+I know it.++I even believe I know where she lives...+$ trails off.
$ tilts her head slightly, thinking and listening.++The trails north of the village...the perytons have taken them over.  I believe she must be living among them there somewhere.  My legs will not lift me any longer...and even if they did, my sight is now gone, so I cannot find her.++But I see her, in my mind.  The trails...they twist and wind...and at the end, where you think you will fall off the earth.  There she is.  Hidden but in plain sight...+$ pauses briefly with a sad, thoughtful expression.+I don't know what end she will meet, but I think we are tied together still...+$ begins rocking in her chair once more, growing completely silent.
