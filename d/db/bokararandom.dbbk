$shakes his head+I hear a few tailors been fighting over that thread...+$mumbles and goes back to work
&hmm+Well I heard someone mention the other day that my son followed some fellow named the Oak Father+&shrug+I don't know how true that is though
$looks around and grins proudly+My son and his friends Schatten and Kaarell, searched around up north and found that eligorian weed they were looking for.+Thankfully they were able to cure Mallido... my son said it's cause the blessing of the forest father was with them, not really sure what he means by that though.+&shrug
$looks around at his customers and smiles+If you want one of these items, you better hurry up and buy them!+There is a profitable market for them, and I aint going to hold any of them back for you.+$grins
$grins proudly+My son has went out on another mission, left a few weeks back. Hear he's going to fight the biggest dragon ever saw in the South...+The dragon should have moved out of there years back+$grins
