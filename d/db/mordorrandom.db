A local friend told me there's a very dangerous half-drow around lately.+Be on guard and pray someone can scare it or disable it badly enough it will go back into hiding or its soul put to rest forever.
A friend from the forest that knows a little magic saw some humans bound near the ferry and an invisible half-drow dragging them around the forest.+He hid real well and stayed safe but was too afraid of such a creature with such power to have three captives to try to rescue them.++He told me all about it though and that terrorizing was around late Winterstime.+Better be on guard and bring some powerful friends or run fast if you see any signs of this half-drow creature.  It had glowing red swords and apparently used powerful magics.
