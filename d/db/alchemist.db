So you like to use arcane magic and fancy yourself a mage do you?+@smile+You'll need to find scrolls to transcribe into your book, but magic is much more than that.  Mystra frowns on magi who take their magic for granted.
Scrolls are often found on dragons or sorceror types.  Don't give up if you ruin a few transcribing them either.  That's just part of learning and when Mystra feels you're ready you'll manage.
If you manage to get many spells in your book, you'll want to have a backup made in the mage tower and leave it there.+A mage who loses their book and doesn't have a backup has to start over collecting spells you know.
When you've saved enough gold you can rent a cubby in the mage tower and store some spare components there.+If you lose your components bag or it gets stolen by a lowlife thief you'll have a LOT of shopping to do if you don't.+$looks around in the shadows cautiously.
If you lose your components bag or it gets stolen by a lowlife thief you'll have a LOT of shopping to do if you don't have spares in a cubby.+You can get an empty bag to start over from the mage tower that's just off the road south of Shadow.
All magi should visit Mystra's temple now and then.  Without her to tend the Weave, arcane magics would ultimately fail.+?class == mage || class == bard+#Mystra's temple is just west of Shadow if you haven't found it yet.+?
Many scrolls are lost in transcribing of course.  If you haven't studied long enough at your magic or aren't as intelligent as others, you may have difficulty understanding the spell well enough to transcribe it successfully.
Most mages learn to use magic missiles early.  They don't require any components so even poor mages can use them freely.
Ah, acid arrow.  A very useful spell indeed.  You'll need a dart of course plus powdered rhubarb leaf and adders stomach.  Those make the acid as you cast.
Chill touch is another that requires nothing more than memorizing and practice.
You might want to find the Inn if you're sleepy.+@smirk+Oh, but you want to know about the components for the sleep spell?  That would be rose petals.
Identify, of course.+?class == mage || class == bard+#That's one you can make some gold to finance your training with if you're smart.  For the price of a pearl and an owlfeather you can not only discern if something is cursed but find out how many enchantments it has.+?+I hear the church charges 500 gold to check for curses alone so identifying the power of enchantments should be easily worth twice that or more.
Buy some blessed leather to create some armor for yourself.  Won't help if you have too much regular armor though of course.
Detecting magic is quite simple and doesn't bring me any business either.  I suppose it's good magi have some spells you can do even if you lose those bags though.
Ever get dirt or sand in your eyes?  So of course colored sand is what you need to create the blinding light for the color spray spell.
Light is a very handy spell of course.  Only takes a little phosphorescent moss and the simple spell to get it to glow then you have light as good as a torch.  It goes out eventually of course, so you might want to carry several.
|speech grumble+Yet another that brings me no income, but I suppose I'll share a little of what I know about it.+|speech+Be careful using it when you're with friends since it seems to be one of those that gets beyond the casters control at times with those flames that flare out.
Gum arabic and an eyelash give you what you need to make yourself invisible to normal sight.+Of course there are disadvantages to being invisible and it's easy to forget that you are, so as with all magic use it sparingly and wisely rather than wastefully.
No, that one doesn't require components either.  I suppose looking into someone's soul is purely mental.
Spider web is used for this one of course.  You might even be amazed at how useful the spell can be.+|speech offer+Not all spells are simply offensive or defensive, some such as this one can help prevent the need for violence entirely.+|speech
They don't call it hideous laughter for nothing.  If you've been forced to laugh so hard you become weak and can't even move in battle you understand.+But you want to know about the components don't you?  So, five minute tarts and a feather for each casting for that one.
To begin with, you must have some basic rope so you might want to visit the general store.+For components though, you need parchment and corn extract to create the stiffening and walls of the special space it creates.
Of course being able to see invisible beings or those in hiding is very useful.+?class == mage || class == bard+#You could probably charge well for this one too since it has great defensive and offensive uses.+?+But of course it is costly.  You'll need talc and powdered silver which creates the salve for your eyes.
|speech mutter+Yet another one that brings me no business, but I suppose young mages who use the lower level spells can't afford much anyway.+Do be warned that I've heard it's another one difficult to control and sometimes causes the caster to make enemies of his or her party instead.+|speech
|speech ask+Ray of enfeeblement?+|speech+Just your motions and having learned the right words make that one work.
|speech caution+Fireball is another one that will go wild on you and may hit your allies so use it with care.  Of course you need sulfur to make the fire and the bat guano is used to form into a ball that will explode and spread.+|speech
Although there are several levels of monster summoning, they all use the same components.  You'll need a tiny bag and small candle for each time you want to summon a few critters to distract whatever you're fighting.
Of course you may want to dispel even your own magic sometimes.  Guess you'll be glad to know it won't cost you anything in components.
Blink seems to help you run free as the winds and you won't be needing anything from me for it.  Maybe Akadi provides a blessing on that one.
@smirk+Of course you want to know about that one.  It might be most widely used of all spells I've seen.  Maybe even more than magic missiles so it's a good thing fireflies are plentiful.
That's another that doesn't help feed my pets but I suppose it helps the young mages struggling for gold to finance their studies to survive.+You have to be skilled enough to get past their armor or dodging to touch the target, but it gives you whatever health it drains from them so you won't need as many of those kits either.
|speech ask+Maybe you heard me mention how important it is to get the exactly right thing?+|speech+@smirk+You'd be amazed how many intelligent mages get mixed up and buy the wrong kind of iron for instance.  Hold person just uses a piece of iron, not a whole rod or such.
