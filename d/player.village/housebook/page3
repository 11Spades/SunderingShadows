		Doors
	       -------

Doors may be added to any exit in your house.
Each door must have a unique name. I would
suggest a name that describes the room it 
leads to. 
IE: the room is the 'bedroom' so I'd name the 
door 'bed' or 'bedroom'.
IE: The room is the 'main entry hall' so i'd name
the door 'main' or 'entry'. But since this door 
will lead to the road, and others may use the 
same door names, you may need to name it something
like 'melnmarn' to denote your house.

The door wizard will make the doors. 
Warning, do not interupt the doorwizard, when he
is casting his spells.
