	      	    Houses
		   --------

Houses may only be built in the player village. 
They may be built in any unused direction from 
the roads. You may only purchase one(1) house.

Additional rooms may be added to the house, but
there is a limit of 10 rooms total, in your house,
including the main room.

You can also change the descriptions of any room.

The house wizard will do all of the above. 
A word of warning, don't interupt the wizard
when he is casting spells.
