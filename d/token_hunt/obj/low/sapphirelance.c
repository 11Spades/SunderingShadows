The sapphire lance is said to have been created when a lightning bolt from the sky stuck an ancient blue cedar during a very powerful and raging storm. The trunk of the tree was severed and within the core, a perfect sliver of straight and perfect wood was found.  As the wood was treated the deep blue coloring became obvious and the weaponsmith who worked on the weapon night and day, soon discovered that the wood had also been touched with something else.  A gift from the stars!
