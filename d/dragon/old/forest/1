the area has been cleared to the ground of trees and undergrowth, the brambles and briars striped away to provide an open area for the storage of freshly felled logs from the forest. in one area small saplings have been replanted, provideing the woodland with new anf fresh growth.

ON the western side of the path is a small stone building witha  rough thatched roof, one wall of which sports a huge pile of longs. obviously the resideant of a wlocal woodcutter. upon the other side of the trail a ssmall area of woodland has been cut back, to provide lumber fo the local inhabitants.

The home of the woodcutter is a spartan but comfortable place, it has a homely and well lived infeeling, but is not cluttered or dirty as you might expect. the floor has been covered with a fllesh scattering of sawdust.

this room is warm and comfortable, it is dominated by a huge wooden bed, sporting the comforable feahter mattress and pill, the whole being tompped with a multicouled patchwork quit. a roaring file burns in a large stonework fireplace in the south wall.
