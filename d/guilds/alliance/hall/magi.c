%^MAGENTA%^The castle Magi room%^RESET%^
This room looks like nothing you have ever seen before.
It is the place where all the castle magi come to study 
their spells. The walls have many different %^BLUE%^c%^RED%^o%^BOLD%^l%^YELLOW%^o%^GREEN%^r%^MAGENTA%^s%^RESET%^. On the 
floor there is %^GREEN%^grass%^RESET%^ growing and the air is filled with 
%^YELLOW%^butterflies%^RESET%^ that seem to be coming from nowhere. In the 
middle of the room you see an old table filled with scrolls, 
paper and ink. Beside the table you see a large pot and in 
it some strange mixture is boiling. At the north wall you 
notice a shelf filled with many different %^ORANGE%^herbs%^RESET%^ and components, 
and on the wall beside the shelf you see a %^MAGENTA%^painting%^RESET%^ of the 
once well-respected castle mage and you wonder who he might be.
