I noticed in message 183 the mention of the shops and gambling rooms will
be on the second floor. The gambling rooms and dog fights were to be on the
first floor. The shops on the second are to be open to the public and the
specialty shops everyone will have to pay a fee for, like Vethors in
Daggerdale or the thieves guild store in Tharis.
Ideas? Comments? Questions?

Mansion plans first edition -

Library - 
The largest room is the library. It has many architectural details
a massive hooded fireplace carved with roaring lions, leaded paned
bookcases filled with a wide variety of books and Fist artifacts, as well
as ornate oak pillars leading up to the dais area. The dais has
comfortable chairs and a divan to relax upon. The dais will also lead you
to the quaint backyard patio, complete with benches, herb garden and apple
tree.

Dining Room - 

The dining room features gleaming sycamore paneling, a rich mahogany table,
finely tiled fireplace with intricate mantel carvings and an original hand
painted mural. The dining room offers an impressive setting for the
masterfully created and presented buffets and meals of the master chef.
Positioned between the pier, the wall space between two windows, is a
gilded pier mirror. The mirror is strategically placed to reflect and
maximize the light from a large candelabra positioned on the table. It is
common to open the pocket doors during a party, allowing music to filter in
from the music room. Most of the furniture can be pushed aside or taken
into the hall to accommodate an evening dance.


Entry -
As you enter through the front door, there is a closet on the right in the
areaway which is handy for coats and cloaks and could be opened by pushing
a button at the side of the closet in the main hall just inside the door.
The walnut walls and parquet flooring are representative of the high
quality of materials used throughout the interior. Set in the ornamental
ceiling are two half-globe stained glass lighting fixtures.

Grand Hall -
This is the grand hall with a cathedral beamed ceiling, walk-in fireplace,
moss rock walls, an elegant patio lined with petunias in season, including
a bar. Hand carved beams are shaped as animal faces and the fireplace
blazes in any season. The connecting patio is spacious and has a lovely
view of the gardens. The gambling rooms adjoin the Grand Hall.

Music Room -
This room has ornate plaster wall panels, a white marble hearth with gold
veining, and the elegant lighting fixtures distinguish this room. The
lattice-patterned parquet floor is meticulous in its workmanship and
exquisite in its beauty. A raised dais of hand worked oak sets the stage
for the bards that come from near and far to enjoy the ambiance and
entertain the guests.

Staircase -
The mansion's four-story staircase spirals to the rooms and belvedere
above, unveiling a panoramic view of the city and the sea.(belvedere is
close for now)

Second Floor Main Hall -
Original oak parquet flooring, painted ornamental plaster ceilings, wall-
mounted lighting fixtures with tulip shades, and a green onyx fireplace
distinguishes the central hall from the other rooms on this floor. A large
onyx-topped table matches the fireplace and the wall table at the head of
the stairs.

Fist Hall - War Room - 
The columns and floor are marble with the overall appearance of light
jade/emerald. Very tiny white veining gives this stone a galaxy effect of
dense star clusters among a background of light to medium green. The walls
are also marble with a deep green background that is overlayed with
contrasting cloud-like clusters of both fine pure white and light green
veins - elliciting motion against stillness. The walls extend 20 foot to a
domed crystal paneled(glass steel?) ceiling. The huge black obsidian
fireplace, hearth and mantle give contrast to the rest of the room. It is
lit by torchs evenly placed along the walls and 3 large candelabras that
sit upon the huge table centered in the room. Plush comfortable leather
chairs sit around the table with a single high backed one at the head. The
table - could be either made of ironwood or take the one from the old hall?
Matching wall tables flank either side of the great table and have such
things as city and topographical maps of the realm. Four statues, one for
each corner, are carved into the likenesses of the four elemental gods,
each of which is based upon neutrality. Ishtishia and Kossuth sit in
opposite corners as do Akadi and Grumbar. Each stand at least 10 feet tall
and are exquisite in detail. The color of marble reflects the colors
associated with that god.

Mage Study -
An expansive eight-windowed round room facing front and north. All the
trappings that a mage could ask for is supplied in abundance: scrolls, ink
and pens, bookcases full of tomes, cubby-holes for neatness and
organization,  maps, filing cabinets - one for each mage of the guild, and
various other asundry items that might come in useful in research and
study. It has one larger desk and chair and a couple of regular sized desks
and chairs spaced out evenly throughout the room. A fireplace sits in the
far wall. A statue of a half-elf stands in the corner of the far wall -
Piezo.
--More-- (50%) 


Lab - 
Lab stuff. Statue of a Voadkyn stands in the far corner - Alfero.

Security -

Whenever a battle is taking place and help is called for - an alarm bell is
rung from that area. The alarm bells ring up on the third floor so that any
members will know of the battle. Each bell is distinct - either it rings
once for each floor or the lowest floor has the lowest tone, second floor a
mid tone, and so on.

Downstairs - Pairs of 0 level guards are stationed in each room. If trouble
starts they call for back up and 4 more enter along with 2 low-mid level
sergeants(or whatever level and title would be appropriate).

Second Floor - Each vendor can defend him/herself reasonably well but upon
being attacked always rings for help. Immediately, 2 low-mid level guards
and 2 mid-high level guards will respond(again adjust the level and title
to be appropriate).

Third Floor - There are 2 mid-high level guards posted outside the War Room
and a single guard for each set of other doors, the Mage Study and Lab. The
statues of the Fist members come to life and attack if the guards start to
fight. 
Inside the Mage Study and Lab there is a single guard that will protect and
member of the guild in the room(unsure of what level the guard would need
to be to do that - probably at least mid-high). The statues of the Fist
members will again animate and attack if a fight begins in there.
In the War Room I'd like the cost of having 4 guards, a thief, a mage, a
cleric, and a fighter protect each Fist member as they enter the room.
Depending on the cost, that can be adjusted accordingly, as with any of
this. If a fight starts one of them calls for help and 8 level 0 guards, 4
low-mid level guards, and 2 mid-high level guards run in to help. The
statues of the elemental gods could do one of a couple things - either
because we have pull with Piezo - big time Akadian and Pyros - big time
Kossuthan - and maybe pull favors elsewhere - they could, when battle
begins, they could transform into greater elementals of thier kind or
simply animate and attack - I prefer the elemental thing myself.

To gain entrance into the War Room - for the guards the member must
'whisper guard death before dishonor' or something - and then to unlock the
door - they must match their tatoo to matching insignias on the door -
'match tatoo' or something.

Third Floor Mainhall -
The hallway has a twelve foot ceiling decorated with an original plaster
rosette, depicting a sunflower and acanthus leaf motif. A brass, gothic
lantern hangs from the rosette, which overlooks a hand-painted floorcloth
extending the entire length of the hall. A marble fireplace adds to the
allure of the area. There is a life sized statue of a firbolg on either
side of the large formidable double doors - Coyotte and Spider.
--More-- (75%) 


Stores - 
Healers, Comps Shop, Gen. Store, Specialty Items Store, Smugglers Den, and
Fence

Gambling Rooms - 
1 - for basic craps
1 - for basic roulette
1 - for blackjack
possibly - 1 for poker or dice poker
1 - for dog fights - invitation only??

Garden with Reflecting Pool


That's it for now. Go over it all. Contact me with questions and comments.
Thanks.

Subject: fist and torm

As the original intent was to basically take over Torm and make it a
neutral town. Shape it up and make it work for us and us it, so to speak. I
was thinking that we would make minor modifications to the laws of shadow
and enforcement and whatnot but use them as a basis to set up Torm.

Instead of a law guild, the fist would be the law guild there. I had
already mailed you all that once we had established ourselves there and
started taking over that we would help set up better training for the
guards and more of them. Possibly even having a group to ride out to that
captain or whatever that sits on the road on the way into town to check on
things and patrol the farms and such. 

I just wanted to put those thoughts back into the recesses of your minds.
When the time is right we can work all that out.

Thanks.
