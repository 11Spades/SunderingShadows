You are on the battlefield known as the Red Fallows.  Once known as the green land, it has been abused by many many combatants.  Over the years hundreds of battles have been fought here.  Once the greatest wheat and grain fields known to Shadow, able to feed everone in the surrounding region for a year, it has been poisoned by the blood of thousands of warriors.  Even now as you look around, you can see the bloodstains, and catch a glimpse of bone or a broken weapon.
