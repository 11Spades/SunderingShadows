//I've updated this and the sword - /d/deku/weapons/gray_longsword.c
//to be base +3 and then +4 when used together - since I've been told
//a lot of the stuff on deku now is +3/+4 - and since these 
//work together and I think they are quite rarely ever used
//together - it should be good - if anyone has a problem 
//or notices one - please let me know, Saide - March 2nd, 2011
