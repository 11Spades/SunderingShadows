    "for the sweet taste of honey tea! "+
    "I hope that wherever my spirit ends up may "+
    "provide the comfort I've long since "+
    "lacked.  I suppose that I will use this to tell "+
    "my story, though I know not why, "+
    "I doubt any letirate creature will ever find this....  "+
    "it's been so long since I've "+
    "saw a friendly being...  Never the less, in case...  "+
    "My name is Ciegwell BiggleToe "+
    "I'm a gnome from a village that I choose not to name.  "+
    "In my younger days I adventured "+
    "with several men, two of them humans, the other an agile "+
    "halfling.  In one of my halfling "+
    "friends adventures he stumbled upon this place.  He snuck about it and gathered "+
    "a great deal of information on it by watching the massive wolves that dwell here"+
    ", he brought that information back to us and told us.  He didn't find any of the "+
    "treasure that he thought might be here, but found out enough to make him curious.  "+
    "Unfortunately, at the time, we were unable to search this place out, and years passed, "+
    "we eventually parted ways, I became sick for some time and during that time "+
    "our human companions learned from the halfling all that he knew of this place "+
    "and journeyed here.  They never returned, a few years later I managed to regain "+
    "my health and alas, my halfling companion was arrested and hanged.  I inherited "+
    "all of his possessions and learned what he had written in a journal about this place.  "+
    "He referred to it as keep blacktongue and mentioned a "+
    "hidden entrance and wolf creatures.  "+
    "He mentioned words activating hieroglyphics and elite "+
    "guards who protected some leader.  "+
    "I decided to come here and try to locate my "+
    "companions, perhaps to journey with them "+
    "to some land we had never ventured to before.  "+
    "It took me some while to scope out the "+
    "place, I quickly learned that the 'Lord Hawk' could "+
    "not be the leader behind what "+
    "my friend had mentioned.  There were no wolves or "+
    "hieroglyphics - I thought perhaps "+
    "that beneath the keep there was some type of lair "+
    "of these wolves, I assumed, after "+
    "some observation, that the rings I saw some of the "+
    "guards of the keep with had a "+
    "significance in entering that lair.  I didn't "+
    "want to confront them head on so "+
    "I searched out the hidden entrance my halfling friend mentioned, I found it quite "+
    "easily and there I found the remains of one of my other companions.  It grieved "+
    "me greatly, it was difficult to go on, but I went forward, in search of my other "+
    "friend.  I never found him or heard any of the command words I'd been told about that "+
    "did something with the hieroglyphics.  I believe now that "+
    "the words are names as my friend "+
    "mentioned, I know not what names though or what effect or "+
    "how, but I did see a hieroglyphic "+
    "of an ogre and then I saw an ogre?  Could there be a connection?  I do not know... "+
    "it is too late to worry now though as the beasts "+
    "finally found me.  They took me before a much "+
    "larger one, who I assumed to be the leader and he tore into me and then threw me "+
    "into this cell.  I've written this here, I know that I will never leave this place,"+
    " I will die here, like my companion.  I do wonder about my other companion, he was "+
    "by all accounts, the strongest of all of us.  He had "+
    "became known as '%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^The Im%^RED%^pal%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^er%^RESET%^' "+
    "among all that knew him.  I can only hope that if he still "+
    "lives, he has given these "+
    "creatures hell.  I do know that even if he is dead, "+
    "a great number of them died with him.  "+
    "I suppose that gives me some measure of comfort.  "+
    "I truly wish that I had never saw "+
    "this forsaken place.  I only hope that whoever "+
    "finds this, whenever that may be, "+
    "encounters a much better fate than I.  I give you my "+
    "best of luck.  I finish this now as "+
