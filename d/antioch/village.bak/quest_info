About the Antioch Quest
=======================
The quest is meant for around levels 10-15 and is not supposed to be easy.
The idea is that the lower level mids need to work together more than the
higher level mids.  It involves more figuring things out than killing tough
monsters, so we will have to trust the players not to share the details.

The idea is to find the 10 elements of power and the elemental wand and
bring them to the man who gives the quest.  The elements are scattered 
throughout Antioch and Ignatius has the wand.  The elements can be found in
the following places:
	green element: in /d/antioch/village/fount_1.c
	red element: in /d/antioch/village/graveyard.c
	demonic element: in /d/antioch/village/snakes.c on qdemon.c
	undead element: in /d/antioch/village/hole1.c on ulord.c
	golden element: in /d/antioch/garrison/cell2.c
	water element: in /d/antioch/village/temple2.c
   lust element: in /d/antioch/castle/castle22.c on lastria.c
   yellow element: in /d/antioch/castle/castle6.c
	blue element: in /d/antioch/village/pit/pool2.c
	crystelic element: in /d/antioch/village/house.c
	Ignatius is in /d/antioch/village/t12.c with the wand

The reward for the quest is 200,000 exp and a chance to raise one of your
stats permanently.
