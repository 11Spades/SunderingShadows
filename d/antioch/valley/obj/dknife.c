The blade is actually made out of %^GREEN%^aventurine%^RESET%^, a green semi-precious stone.  The thick blade tapers to a fine, sharp, point.  The %^GREEN%^aventurine %^RESET%^is veined with %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^lighter green f%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^le%^BOLD%^cks %^RESET%^against the %^GREEN%^deeper green %^RESET%^base color, giving a vibrant quality to the stone.

The kama is one of those strange weapons that came about from a harvest tool.  The kama is much like a sickle in many ways, though without the sharp curve the sickle posses.  The kama is used to harvest grains.  Many druids have come to adopt the kama as one of their favored weapons, mainly due to it’s small size.  The aventurine used in this kama’s blade is a sacred stone to the followers of Mielikki.  A curious story surrounds the braided length of hair that wraps around the kama.  Some sages believe it to be actually dryad hair, and if unbraided one will find a single white strand in the center of the braid-given by a unicorn.  Though the braid seems resistant to anyone attempting to unbraid it, tangling about itself as if living.
