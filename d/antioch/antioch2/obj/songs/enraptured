Enraptured I Gaze

Enraptured I Gaze, when my Delia is by,
And drink the sweet poison of love from her eye;
I feel the soft passion pervade ev'ry part,
And pleasures unusual play round my fond heart.

I hear her sweet voice, and am charm'd with her song,
I think I could hear her sweet voice all day long;
My senses enchanted are lost in delight
When love and soft music their rapture unite.

Beyond all expression my Delia I love;
My heart is so fix'd that it never can rove;
When I see her I think 'tis an angel I see,
And the charms of her mind are a heav'n to me.
