Open your eyes little one,
And see the world around you.
There are wonders you have never explored,
Never dreamed of or imagined.
There's a world out there, take a look and see.
Open your eyes.

Open your heart little one,
Don't be afraid to feel.
going through life cold and numb is a waste.
There is so much warmth out there,
The people who love you are real.
Open your heart.

Open your arms little one,
Embrace the ones you care about.
You never know when it's last time you'll see,
Show them how much you care,
Quickly before their time runs out.
Open your arms.
