Blow the Candles Out

When I was apprenticed in Shadow
I went to see my dear
The candles all were burning
The moon shone bright and clear.
I knocked upon her window
To ease her of her pain
She rose up to let me in
Then barred the door again.

I like your well behaviour
And this I often say
I cannot rest contented
When I am far away.
The roads they are so muddy
We cannot walk about
So roll me in your arms my love
And blow the candles out.

Your father and your mother
In yonder room do lie
A-hugging one another
So why not you and I?
A-hugging one another
Without a fear or doubt
So roll me in your arms my love
And blow the candles out.

I prithee speak more softly
Of what we have to do
Lest that our noise of talking
Should make our pleasure rue.
The streets they are so nigh, love
The people walk about
They may peep in and spy, love
So blow the candles out.

And if we prove successful, love
Please name it after me.
Treat it neat and kiss it sweet
And daff it on your knee.
When my three years are over
My time it will be out
And I will pay my debt to you
By blowing the candles out.

Oh, Breathe Not His Name

Oh, breathe not his name,
Let it sleep in the shade,
Where cold and unhonored,
His relics are laid;
Sad, silent and dark
Be the tears that we shed,
As night dew that weeps
On the grave o'er his head.

But the night dew that falls,
Tho' in silence it weeps,
Shall brighten with vendure
The grave where he sleeps;
And the tears that we shed,
Tho' in secret it rolls,
Shall long keep his memory
Green in our souls.
