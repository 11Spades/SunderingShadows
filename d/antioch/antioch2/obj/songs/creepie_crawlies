Do you hear the whispered voices
   in the darkness of the night?
Do you hear the little 'uns crying
   as they're hidden out of sight?
Do you hear the creepie crawlies
   as they sneak into the town?
Do %^BOLD%^they%^RESET%^ hear the pounding of your heart
    as you're pressed against the ground?

They howl and they slither and run on many legs,
And the monster hunters catch 'em and throw 'em into bags!
They hiss and they chatter and flap their filthy wings,
And the monster hunters stalk 'em and kill the wretched things!

Do you fear the moving shadows
   as you're walking all alone?
Do you fear that something evil
   might slip into your home?
Do you fear the hot breath
   that breathes upon your neck,
When nothing seems to be there
   each time you turn around to check?

They howl and they slither and run on many legs,
And the monster hunters catch 'em and throw 'em into bags!
They hiss and they chatter and flap their filthy wings,
And the monster hunters stalk 'em and kill the wretched things!

Do you believe in the monster
   that's hiding beneath your bed?
Do you believe in the many voices
   that whisper in your head?
Do you believe that someone's coming
   to lend a helping hand?
Or do you believe the one who's coming
   is the BOOGEYMAN?!?

They howl and they slither and run on many legs,
And the monster hunters catch 'em and throw 'em into bags!
They hiss and they chatter and flap their filthy wings,
And the monster hunters stalk 'em and kill the wretched things!
But in the darkness of the night, your fears become undone,
And from the recesses of your mind, the creepie crawlies come!
