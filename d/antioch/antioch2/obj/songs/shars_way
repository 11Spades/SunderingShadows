"Shar's Way"

Darkened whispers in the night
   echo deeply in your mind,
Nightmares stir a horrid fright,
   you fear for what you just might find.
Loneliness and loss console you,
   a numbing cold soothes your soul,
The murky clouds obscure your view,
   truth is a long forgotten goal.
You followed a path of good intentions
   into the depths of deep despair.
You've thought of all possible preventions,
   but somehow have simply ceased to care.

You hear Her whispers in your mind,
   shadows caress your aching heart.
You leave that miserable life behind
   and yield to Her darkened art.

And so another light extinguished,
And so another slips Her way,
Will all the lights soon be vanquished?
Eternal night would swallow day.
