The Ballad of Sir Tylorune

     His mithril armor burnished bright,
     One gauntlet black, the other white.
     His helm alive with brilliant light,
     His longsword danced with flame.

     This hero faced his greatest test;
     This battle would complete his quest.
     The shield he carried bore his crest;
     Sir Tylorune was his name.

     For courage and for strength he prayed,
     To Tyr, the god who he obeyed.
     His trust and faith would give him aid;
     He would not fight alone.

     "For honor, and for Tyr!", he roared,
     And leapt to battle for his lord.
     Opposing that unholy sword,
     He charged to match his own.

     And locked in battle, toe to toe,
     He stood against his mortal foe,
     Exchanging blow for deadly blow,
     A small and savage war.

     The damage done by each was vast;
     He knew his health was failing fast.
     The next exchange might be the last;
     He could not stand much more.

     And yet he vowed he would not yield.
     He stood his ground, and raised his shield,
     To win or die upon this field;
     The fateful moment neared.

     And in his rival, there was doubt.
     Afraid that he might lose this bout,
     The man of evil's nerve gave out;
     The coward disappeared.

     His masquerade of honor gone,
     With craven guile, this evil spawn
     Did soon return, to battle on;
     Most foully did he fight.

     But at our hero's side now stood
     The valiant Order Knights, who would,
     United on the side of good,
     Prove steadfast in their might.

     Courageously, they joined the fray,
     And only Arawn ran away.
     At last the party won the day,
     And killed the wicked beast.

     Remember well, and heed this tale;
     The noble hearted will not fail.
     For in the end, the good prevail,
     And evil will be greased.
