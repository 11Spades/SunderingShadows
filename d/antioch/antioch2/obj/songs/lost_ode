sing I hear the wind blow through the trees,
sing yet I only can see your hair,
sing falling into your eyes,
sing the last time I saw you...
sing The gentle summer's rain on the roof,
sing reminds me of your voice,
sing gentle and quiet in my ear,
sing when you last said I love you.
emote sighs and looks down sadly.
sing the last time I saw you before...
sing before you said goodbye.
emote sighs deeply and tries to keep his voice clear.
sing But I wait,
sing And I try to understand the reasons,
sing but I can't
sing and every day my heart of glass
sing splinters and cracks a bit more
sing I feel a little more pain
sing that i thought I was dulled to,
sing but I never was...
sing and now I know
sing I shall never be whole again.
sing because when the wind blows the trees,
sing I see your eyes, hiding behind your hair
sing and every time the summer rain falls on the roof,
sing I miss your voice.
sing but...
sing every one woman I see,
sing pales in comparison to you,
sing But the worst part of it all, is..
emote strums his strings of his lute slowly, letting the echo hang in the
air.
sing is I know I will be...
sing forever alone.
