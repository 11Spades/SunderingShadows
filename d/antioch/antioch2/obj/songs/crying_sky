"Crying Skies"

The sky is crying
   for my broken heart.
The tears are falling
   as we are forced to part.
The flowers on the window sill
   I gave you yesterday.
I can feel your warm breath still,
   hear your heart beating away.
Yet I stare unbelieving
   into your unseeing eyes;
Reality must be deceiving,
   we didn't even say goodbyes.

The bagpipes are playing
   as dirt's shoveled on your grave,
I hear what no one's saying,
   holding the memories I've saved.
Your smile, so lovely,
   your touch, so soft,
Now I'm so lonely,
   so broken and lost.

The sky is still crying
   for my broken heart,
The tears drip-drop falling,
   slowly tearing me apart.
