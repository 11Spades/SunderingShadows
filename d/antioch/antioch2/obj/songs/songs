Enraptured I Gaze

Enraptured I Gaze, when my Delia is by,
And drink the sweet poison of love from her eye;
I feel the soft passion pervade ev'ry part,
And pleasures unusual play round my fond heart.

I hear her sweet voice, and am charm'd with her song,
I think I could hear her sweet voice all day long;
My senses enchanted are lost in delight
When love and soft music their rapture unite.

Beyond all expression my Delia I love;
My heart is so fix'd that it never can rove;
When I see her I think 'tis an angel I see,
And the charms of her mind are a heav'n to me.

Black is the Color of my True Love's Hair

Black, black, black 
is the color of my true love's hair
Her lips are like a rose so fair
And the prettiest face and the neatest hands.
I love the grass whereon she stands
She with the wondrous hair.

Black, black, black
is the color of my true love's hair
Her face is something truly rare.
Oh I do love my love and so well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes.
She with the wondrous hair.

Black, black, black
is the color of my true love's hair
Alone, my life would be so bare.
I would sigh, I would weep,
I would never fall asleep
My love is 'way beyond compare
She with the wondrous hair.
Black, black, black
is the color of my true love's hair.

Blow the Candles Out

When I was apprenticed in Shadow
I went to see my dear
The candles all were burning
The moon shone bright and clear.
I knocked upon her window
To ease her of her pain
She rose up to let me in
Then barred the door again.

I like your well behaviour
And this I often say
I cannot rest contented
When I am far away.
The roads they are so muddy
We cannot walk about
So roll me in your arms my love
And blow the candles out.

Your father and your mother
In yonder room do lie
A-hugging one another
So why not you and I?
A-hugging one another
Without a fear or doubt
So roll me in your arms my love
And blow the candles out.

I prithee speak more softly
Of what we have to do
Lest that our noise of talking
Should make our pleasure rue.
The streets they are so nigh, love
The people walk about
They may peep in and spy, love
So blow the candles out.

And if we prove successful, love
Please name it after me.
Treat it neat and kiss it sweet
And daff it on your knee.
When my three years are over
My time it will be out
And I will pay my debt to you
By blowing the candles out.

Oh, Breathe Not His Name

Oh, breathe not his name,
Let it sleep in the shade,
Where cold and unhonored,
His relics are laid;
Sad, silent and dark
Be the tears that we shed,
As night dew that weeps
On the grave o'er his head.

But the night dew that falls,
Tho' in silence it weeps,
Shall brighten with vendure
The grave where he sleeps;
And the tears that we shed,
Tho' in secret it rolls,
Shall long keep his memory
Green in our souls.

The Ash Grove

Down yonder green valley where streamlets meander
When twilight is fading, I pensively roam
Or at the bright noontide in solitude wander
Amid the dark shades of the lonely Ash grove
Twas there while the blackbird was cheerfully singing
I first met that dear one, the joy of my heart
Around as for gladness the bluebells were ringng
Ah then little knew I, how soon we would part.

Still glows the bright sunshine, oer valley and mountain
Still warbles the blackbird, its note from the tree
But what are the beauties of nature to me?
With sorrow, deep sorrow, my bosom is laden
All day I go wandering in search of my love
Ye echoes Oh tell me, where is that bright maiden?
She sleeps neath the green turf, down by the ash grove.
