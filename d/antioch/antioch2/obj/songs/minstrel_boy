The Minstrel Boy
The minstrel boy to the war is gone,
In the ranks of death you'll find him.
His father's sword he has girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him.
"Land of song!" said the warrior bard,
"Though all the world betrays thee,
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee."

The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chain
Could not bring that proud soul under.
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
Fore he tore its chords a sunder.

And said, "No chain shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and bravery
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
They shall never sound in slavery."
