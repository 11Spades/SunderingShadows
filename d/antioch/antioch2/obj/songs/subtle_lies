"Subtle Lies"

     Our subtle lies,
     Our hidden shame;
     A somber pit
     Of bleak remorse.
     Can we admit
     We are to blame;
     Could we give rise
     To such a force?

     We make our choice,
     We shed our tears;
     How great our thirst,
     How great our goals.
     The best and worst
     Of hopes and fears;
     A nameless voice
     Which drinks our souls.
