The Glory of Adventure

     When the enemy's surrounding,
     and we think our nerves will fail,
     when we hear the trumpets sounding,
     and they make us quake and quail,
     grab your mug and we'll be pounding
     down another round of ale!

     And we'll drink,
     to the glory of adventure!

     If there ever comes the day
     when we think that we are lost,
     when we think that we must pay
     that most dear and final cost,
     we'll just pass around the tray,
     and feel better when we're sauced!

     And we'll drink,
     to the glory of adventure!

     When we're angry and upset,
     'cause we ain't been getting paid,
     when we're tired, cold and wet,
     and a little bit afraid,
     we'll keep drinking and forget
     that we ever were dismayed!

     And we'll drink,
     to the glory of adventure!

     When the boredom makes us jumpy,
     and the motion makes us ill,
     when the food is cold and lumpy,
     a disgusting, slimy swill,
     there's no reason to be grumpy;
     tap the keg, and drink your fill!

     And we'll drink,
     to the glory of adventure!

     When the captain's really sore,
     'cause he thinks he's being mocked,
     when he's pounding on our door,
     and we're certain to get socked,
     have a drink, and tease him more;
     we'll feel nothing if we're crocked!

     And we'll drink,
     to the glory of adventure!
