"A Bard's Farewell"

     You soon will be out facing danger and strife,
     You soon will be fighting and risking your life.
     I know there is use for my saber and knife;
     Alas, I will not be along.

     We all have our limits, and I'm nearing mine;
     And so, with your pardon, I'll have to decline,
     For I've an appointment with women and wine,
     And gaming and music and song.

     It's been far too long since I've gambled and drank,
     Too long in that dungeon, disgusting and dank,
     Too long amidst refuse, repulsive and rank,
     Too long without love and romance.

     Before I embark on some hazardous quest,
     Before once again I am put to the test,
     If I don't take time to recover and rest,
     My sanity hasn't a chance.

     It's not that your company isn't a thrill,
     I'm truly impressed with your courage and skill,
     And happy to journey beside you; but still,
     I need to be free for a time.

     When we meet again, we'll have stories to share,
     So go with the Gods; good luck, and take care.
     May travel be pleasant, and fortune be fair,
     And may you find meter and rhyme.
