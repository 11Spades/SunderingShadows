The Flight of the Paladins

     The sky is the stage, with a storm all around;
     The audience helplessly waits on the ground.

     The dragons above claim the sky as their own,
     And flame marks the path over which they have flown.

     Then up from below comes a thunderous cry;
     The paladin airborne appears in the sky!

     Each knight on his Pegasus, lances at hand;
     To battle they ride, in a glorious stand.

     Mere words can't describe the magnificent fight,
     As dragon and paladin battle this night.

     Raw courage and steel against talon and breath,
     As more than one hero earns honor in death.

     The blood of both evil and good falls like rain,
     But when it is over, no dragons remain.

     Perhaps but a dream, or a vision, and yet,
     Those sharing this vision shall never forget.
