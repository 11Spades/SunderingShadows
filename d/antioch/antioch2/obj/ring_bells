"Ring their Bells"

Slashing through the Orcs
     With a good two-handed blade
     Over corpses we go
     And through the gore we wade
     Mace on helmet rings
     Making bodies fly
     What fun to sing our Slaying Song
     And watch these suckers DIE!

     (chorus)

     Oh, ring their bells with swords and spells
     Don't let 'em get away!
     We're brave and bold for fame and gold
     We'll make a lot today!
     Oh, ring their bells with swords and spells
     Don't let 'em get away!
     We'll hack and slash and blast and trash
     And blow these dudes away!

     Crashing through the door
     Into the Dragon's nose
     Our mage whips out a Cone of Cold
     And out his fire goes!
     Elven bowstrings sing
     Making Balrogs fall
     And our theif finds a secret door
     Into the treasure hall!

     (chorus)

     Then appears the Lich
     With his demon guard
     Our wizard yawns and wishes
     We'd run into something hard.
     He begins to cast
     His 19th level spell
     The damn lich throws a Gate at us
     And drops us all in Hell!

     (chorus)

     We appear in Hell
     In front of Satan's throne
     Our Cleric waves us out the door
     And takes him on alone!
     Satan's legions don't
     Want to let us go
     Our Techno pulls a bazooka out
     And NUKES 'em 'till they GLOW!

     Oh, ring their bells with Prayers and Spells
     Don't let 'em get away!
     We're brave and bold and CRAZED, we're told
     To think we'll live the day!
     Oh, ring their bells with swords and SHELLS
     Don't let 'em get away!
     We'll hack and slash and blast and trash
     And drag our loot away!
