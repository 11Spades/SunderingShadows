    Hidden deep in the mystical forests of Nolesti, an elven
    kingdom lives.  The grand city of the nolesti elves get
    ready for war as the humans continue to cut down their
    trees.  The humans have also been reported slaughtering 
    some weak elven priests.  The king of the elves will not
    let them get away with this this time.
