// Tharis Church Remodle - Created in February 2009 by Ari

/* Author's note: This room is meant to accomplish two 
things.  The first is to provide a meeting room for player 
use that is somewhat removed.  As it was agreed that 
most of old Tharis' underground tunnels were superfluous
and unneeded, we removed them.  However, the city is 
a thief city so having a couple hidden rooms seemed
like a good idea.  
The second reason is I felt there should be a way
to access the underground roadways (Nienne/Ari's 
project).  This room's design is meant less for meetings
and more for laying bodies out for viewing.  Then, 
through manipulating a lever in the lanterns, a panel
could be opened to access the catacombs and eventually
the underground pathways.  I felt the church was the
most logical as players may revive in them after death
and this would give a pathway out for "beast races". */
