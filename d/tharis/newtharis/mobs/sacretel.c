@OLI
   This droopy-eyed middle-aged man has dark rough hands from frequently
handling the spit and the hot coals under it. He takes this task very 
seriously. He has a high brow with deep dark yet receeding hair. Clean shaven,
he looks around the tavern as he paces back and forth between the bar and 
the turning spit. Occasionally he will pour some spicey smelling liquid over
the turning meat. You can hear the liquid pop and sizzle as it hits the hot 
coals.
