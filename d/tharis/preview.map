// This is a rough overview map of the realm of Tharis. //
// The main road is a continuation of the great southern road //
// throught Darkwood. //
// The city of Tharis is a great trade city, having exploited //
// the resources of the great barrier mountains fo some time. //
// The city was at one point known for the fain and amazingly //
// efficient government.  Lately the government has been turned //
// toward the lawful evil side.  The influence of the great //
// wood elf civilization has been reduced to almost nothing -- //
// only shards of memories remain.  What's more is their //
// presence is almost non-existant.  The mountains are riddled //
// with abandoned mines, from eons of work done by the //
// omnipresent gnomes and dwarves.  The mines are open to all //
// adventure-seeking players.  I only have plans for three of //
// the closed mines directly to the west of the city.  The new //
// ruler of Tharis is a powerful ______ -- I haven't decided how //
// powerful; I really want to say dragon, but that might be //
// extreme.  Whatver it is, it has gained a powerful hold //
// on the tribes and civilizations of humanoids, and others //
// on the other side of the mountains.  This aspect is still //
// wide open to those who want to consider how it should be //
// organized.  The initial part of the campaign in this //
// realm is the players' arrival and commission by the //
// government to find the raiders who are stealing ore //
// while it is being shipped from the western mines to the //
// city.  The players are supposed to do some invesigating. //
// They find several things, including the elves, and //
// discover their plight -- huge groups of evil humanoids //
// are taking them in small numbers, and they cannot ask //
// the city for help.  The players also discover during //
// this stage that they are tools of the government -- the //
// government is taking the goods to build a capital //
// opposite Tharis on the other side of the mountains.  //
// The players are a simple little ploy to satisfy the //
// Dwarves and Gnome-ish miners. //
// The realm is wide open.  The forests are completely //
// open -- one dwarvish lumber camp and the near-empty //
// elvish world.  That leaves a lot of space for //
// treeants and such.  The mountains are much too empty //
// and the presence of the old mines should be exploited. //
// And of course the entire realm of the other city needs //
// to be dealt with. //
// A lot to do, but do-able.  Please let us coordinate //
// and get the work done to get the area opened. //
