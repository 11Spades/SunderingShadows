Fluttering wings and giggling glees
Sputtering lights lead on through the stalks
Armored man with sword in hand-
Muttering of giving chase and exhaustion great

Candy taken from toadstool rings
Dandy to taste, wisks away to faraway place
To the mushroom forests and fairy land
Sandy beds of sprite flowers bloom-
	-till midnight have or be one soon

Biding time till lying sleep
Hiding girl from visored sight
Can he rescue? Can he press on with stamina grand?
Chiding effort with mocking tones, sprites take wing

Candy taken from toadstool rings
Dandy to taste, wisks away to faraway place
To the mushroom forests and fairy land
Sandy beds of sprite flowers bloom-
	-till midnight have or be one soon

Daughter to trickster spirits fell
Water gone and food no more
Tonite for family man makes stand
Caught 'er back or sprite song she will sing

Candy taken from toadstool rings
Dandy to taste, wisks away to faraway place
To the mushroom forests and fairy land
Sandy beds of sprite flowers bloom-
	-till midnight have or be one soon

Fluttering wings and same brown eyes
Sputtering sadness chokes the his words
Lies down to sleep forever in the sand
Muttering of sprite daughter while feeding the stalks

Candy taken from toadstool rings
Dandy to taste, wisks away to faraway place
To the mushroom forests and fairy land
Sandy beds of sprite flowers bloom-
	-till midnight have or be one soon
