You have found yourself just outside the South Gate of the City of
Shadow.  To the south of you stretches the Royal Southern Road that
passes through a dark forest to the town of Tharis far to the south of
here.  Looking to the east and west of you you notice the campground of
a band of barbarians and a few guard posts, where the guards keep a wary
eye on the visitors.
