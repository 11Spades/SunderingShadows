  Lord Krink is one of the heroes of the Old Days of Shadow, having
lead the armies of the gods against the terrifying power of the two
evil immortal Archlords of Shadow: Kai the Despot and Belphy the
Foolish.  His skill is legendary and his name is enscribed on the
monument in Shadow, a lasting testiment to his service to the
realms.

  Now, evil has come again to the ancient City and a risen
Archlord has returned and disturbed his rest.  The Marquis has now
been driven out of his Chateau by combined forces of Aloysius and
Lord Kai, who now leads the Death's Head Legion to reclaim his
place.

  If you are brave enough and strong enough, you can enter the
Chateau and fight the minions of the evil powers.  If you are even
braver, you can <talk to the marquis> and he will give you a
dangerous quest, perhaps even to face Aloysius or Kai themselves. 
Consider carefully.
