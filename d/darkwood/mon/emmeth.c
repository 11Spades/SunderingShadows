  Lord Emmeth is a powerfully built man in the prime of his life. 
His skill on the battlefield and behind the scenes has earned him
the rank of General in Aloysius' mercenary army.

  Although he leads mercenaries, he is not for sale.  His sole
allegience belongs to Aloysius the Archmage, a man who delivered him
certain death on Attaya at the hands of the undead he sought to
vanquish.  Today, he still carrys the equipment he won from that
evil place, as he has vowed to return one day to crush Intruder and
take his place.
