// Adapted from Bane's Laerad commandos by Styx for the Tabor jail

/* *************
* Notes to those creating new ones or to follow up to handle here
* Need to have a proper ID of JailLoc_guard set or added from a callout in create
* Have a set_key also ?? 
*   - would have to use a callout to load it so do that with the add_id??
* !! or, have an is_law(JailLoc) function and a variable setting them for that?
* Leave the attack special function but let it be overridden?
