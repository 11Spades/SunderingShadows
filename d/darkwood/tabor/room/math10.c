%^BOLD%^Mathowvy Road, Tabor%^RESET%^
You are on a fairly steep upward slope on Mount Tabor, approaching the
fortress of %^YELLOW%^Caer Tabor%^RESET%^.  The road is starting to narrow here and
you see it curve around a bend to the northwest.  Directly east
is a large, rounded building made of what looks to be crystalline
walls.  To the west is a small empty lot that appears to be a work in progress.  To the south, you see the slope become gentler and the
road get wider as it leads straight into town.
