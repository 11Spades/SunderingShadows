tower reminds you of a place you may have seen at some point, or at 
least heard about in your travels.  An active wall of what appears to be
%^YELLOW%^lightning %^RESET%^rings the tower, blocking your passage to the entrance.  
Strangely, there is no apparent way to cross it.  The tower is built 
on a %^ORANGE%^rocky outcropping %^RESET%^that looks to have vertical, 
magically smoothed faces on all sides except facing the road you are on. 

%^CYAN%^Wizard's Way %^RESET%^continues to the north and south.
