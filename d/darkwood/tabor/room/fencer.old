This small room is strangely free of dust, despite the fact 
that it looks like a storage room.  Crates and barrels of ale 
are stacked around the walls, along with what looks to be 
padded crates of extra mugs and glasses.  Strangely, a large 
storage cabinet is in the back, locked with a thick iron lock.  
Just before the cabinet is a desk, with a comfortable padded 
chair behind it.
