Due to many recent attacks in our fair city, the royal government under his %^MAGENTA%^Royal Majesty King Cirillo %^RESET%^has determined that further actions must be taken against such aggressors.  Henceforth, the following laws shall be applied within the city limits and within sight of its gates.

1.  Concerning the matter of theft and mugging within the city:

The accusation of theft shall be taken seriously and will be handled by inquiries with government officials after a formal statement is given to the magistrate's office and a complaint lodged.  Any offender who is found guilty will face the following consequences:
      A - A first offense shall be punishable by a fine to be 
          determined by the magistrate.  Restitutions must 
          also be made to the victim.
      B - A second offense shall be punishable by a greater fine 
          and 30 days within the Tabor Gaol.
      C - A third offense shall result in either:
            - The branding of the offender's forehead with the mark 
              of a thief as well as the loss of one of the thief's 
              hands.  The thief will then be banished from the city 
              on pain of death.
                           %^BOLD%^- %^RED%^OR %^WHITE%^-%^RESET%^
            - Death by beheading.
      D - After the third offense, the thief will be put to death 
          as he is clearly incapable of reforming.

2.  Concerning the matter of attempted murder within the city:

Any attack made within the city must be reported to the magistrate.  It will then be investigated swiftly and all aspects of the case considered before punishment is dealt.  All attacks within the city that do not result in death will be considered attempted murder.  Any offender who is found guilty will face the following consequences:
      A - A first offense shall be punishable by a fine to be 
          determined by the magistrate and may be accompanied 
          by 30 days in the Tabor Gaol or service to the city.
      B - A second offense shall be punishable by 60 days in 
          the Tabor Gaol and/or service to the city, as well 
          as the surrendering of all manner of arms and armor, 
          including but not limited to weapons, spell books, 
          components bags, armor, and the like.
      C - A third offense will result in the death of the 
          offender by beheading.  All of his belongings will 
          be forfeit and will go to the city coffers.

3.  Concerning the matter of murder within the city:

Any attack made within the city that results in the death of the victim will be considered murder.  Cases of murder are very serious and will be handled as such.  One of two punishments will be given for any murder, regardless of whether it is a first offense or not.
      A - The murderer may be stripped of all earthly belongings, 
          his funds seized, and all used to pay restitutions to 
          the family of the deceased with the remaining going to 
          the city coffers.  At that time, the murderer will be 
          lead to the yard of the Tabor Gaol, where he will be 
          stoned to death by the citizens of Tabor.
                           - OR -
      B - The murderer may be stripped of all earthly belongings, 
          his funds seized, and all used to pay restitutions to 
          the family of the deceased with the remaining going to 
          the city coffers.  At that time, the murderer will be 
          lead to the gates of the city, and banished from it 
          for the rest of his lifetime on pain of death should 
          he return.

4.  Concerning the matter of ogres, half-ogres, hobgoblins, bugbears, goblins, orcs, ogre-magi, gnolls, kobolds, drow, half-drow, and any other race deemed a threat to the citizens of Tabor.

These races have increasingly become a problem within the city walls, and to this end, they are henceforth %^BOLD%^%^RED%^banned %^RESET%^from the city.  Any of these "lesser races" seen within the city are to be considered a threat to our city and way of life.  Anyone found attacking said races will not be subject to the attempted murder and murder punishments above.  %^BOLD%^However, any property damage and/or endangering of citizens will be dealt with appropriately.%^RESET%^

These laws have been put in place for the protection of the city of Tabor and our way of life.  Should anyone find these laws distasteful, you are welcome to find another place to visit.  For those of you not from our fair city who have come to embrace the love of learning and culture that is Tabor, we welcome you to enjoy your time here within the broad limits of these laws.

Signed by the hand of the magistrate of Tabor in service to his Royal Majesty King Cirillo,

Davarian Slythe, Magistrate of Tabor

[OOC - "Reports" may be made through PKmails.  Be sure to include that the attack was in Tabor and where.  If the situation does not warrant a PKmail (ie, someone stole from you), you may avatarmail your report.]
