                        The Marquis d'Arcy Quest
                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The following is just a few ideas for the first quest for Darkwood.  Any
comments/suggestions/ideas are more than welcome!

The quest starts off when a group of adventures are invited by Marquis
d'Arcy for a visit.  The adventures learn that an ancient magical
family heirloom has been stolen from the Marquis, who is very, very
upset.  Marquis d'Arcy tells the adventures of a great riches which
would be gladly rewarded for the return of his most precious family
heirloom.

To aid with the quest, d'Arcy mentions that he suspects an evil
magician has taken the heirloom in an act of revenge against d'Arcy
for the justice that he imposed on the magician for his/her evil
acts.

The players would learn that the evil magician is may be hidden in a 
tower located within the heart of Darkwood Forest.  Upon finding the
tower after braving the minions of the forest, the player indeed find
the tower, but it is surrounded by a living wall of trees which they
can not find passage through.  It is rumoured that a group of outcast
Kobolds have begun to worship the magician as a 'God' in a temple also
located in Darkwood Forest.  Thus, the adventures seek the Kobolds in
hope to learn more of the magician.  Within the temple is a mirror used
by the Shaman Kobolds to meet with their 'God', but it does not permit
the 'unfaithfull' to pass through it.  But, there is a young Water Troll
which is found near Darklake who has a Stone of Shattering.  If this
Stone is retrieved, it may be used to shatter the mirror, and allow
the adventures passage into the tower where they may search for the
magician and thus a battle rages.  The object may be retrieved and
returned to d'Arcy.

I have coded a good chunk of the Darkwood Forest and the Temple which
is small and humble.  The magician tower yet has to be coded, along
with the Marquis area.

What thinkest you of that M'Lords and M'Ladies?
