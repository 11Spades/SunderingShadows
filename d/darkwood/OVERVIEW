OVERVIEW

	Darkwood Forest area is basically that area directly to the South of
Shadowgate.  The players start on the Royal Southern Road and proceed
through Darkwood Forest.  At the very south end of the road is the
Chateau D'Arcy, a grand manse with a short quest for midlevel players.
In the forest itself are your standard wild animals, one or two
brigands, a Knight Errant and maybe a pixie or two.  The forest houses
the entrance to a small underground cave network (standard dungeon) and
a wizard's  tower (for the quest).


QUEST

	An evil magician is menacing the holdings of the Marquis d'Arcy.
The job of the adventurer is to kill him and retrieve an ancient
magical family heirloom in the process, obviously stolen by the 
wizard.  The Marquis will pay the adventurer a respectable ammount of
gold and maybe give him an item or two.
