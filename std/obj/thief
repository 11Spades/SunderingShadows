   The thief is the master of the shadows.  Their attacks are based
on surprise, jumping from the shadows to deal great damage upon
a target.  <stab> target will deal a great blow of damage.  It 
depends upon move silently and hide in shadows skills.  You can also
<scramble> while you are in combat, this will help you to dodge enemy
attacks and try to position you for another backstab.
Note:  Stabbing will cause you to be unable to leave the room for a 
       period of time and of course scrambling makes you entirely too
       busy to do so.

Armor allowed:  Nothing heavier than leather types (although studded
   leather is allowed).  Thieves (aka rogues) rely on stealth, so 
   anything with metal against metal is going to be too noisy.  They
   can wear bracers.  A high dexterity (which helps with dodging
   attacks too) is very important and useful to thieves.

Thieves have skills such as :
   pick pockets -> pp <target> (money)
   **NOTE** A thief is able to <plant> items on 
   different creatures. 
   pick locks -> pick <lock> on <what>  
   pick pockets -> steal <item> from <target> (items)
   hide in shadows -> hide_in_shadows
   **NOTE** To move out of the shadows once hidden a thief
   can <step>
   move silently -> sneak <direction>
   back stab -> stab <target>
   detect noise -> detect noise <exit>
   scrolls -> use scroll
   investigating a target -> spy <living>
   find/remove traps -> this allows you to find or remove traps. It
	                has the following syntaxes.  <help trap> expands
		        on what is here.

  To find traps:
	trap find on <what>
  To remove traps:
	trap remove when I <action> the <aspect> on <object>
  OR
	trap remove when I <action> the <object> 
  

** NOTE ** <skills> is a very important command. Use it every 
time you level, including when you first make your character. 
Be sure to use a 0 when you want no entry.
