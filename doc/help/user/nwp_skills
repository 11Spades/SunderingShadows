descriptions for crafting nwps (tailor,jewel, armorsmith and weaponsmith) 
They can also be used for RPing your other skills

1-3 You are still learning it.  There is going to be lots of flaws, as you
are stil learning

4-6 You are getting better, but still struggle over some issues of your
craft

7-9 Almost near shop quality.  There still are some flaws, but they might
be small (but you still should include them in the desc)

10-12 "average" Ie on the same level as most merchants sell

13-15 above average.  You are trying some new tricks (like beading
for;tailoring, ornate flutes and/or spikes in armorsmithing, stylized
weapons

16-18 Your skill has grown.  You are a near master of your craft and many
students come to you

19-20 Grand master.. IE you are in the top class

20+ grand masters are even in awe of your flawless ability.  You've
developed your own secrets that others drool over
