There is a complex bounty system in ShadowGate. There is a legal bounty system that is mostly determined by the players. You can reference help legal bounties for more information. Note that you can mail law when you feel someone deserves a legal bounty for their actions. Some people will also receive bounties for their attacks on non-player characters (NPCs), as well, if it is within a lawful city.

There is also a mycause bounty system. This fluctuates often, and is based upon the actions of the players. People who consistantly perform good acts will receive a good bounty on their heads, those who perform evil acts will get an evil bounty. You can look at help mycause for some more information, it is also a command to list the currently known bounties.

There are also personal bounties that can be posted at a bounty board. These will be collected by assassins (or revoked by them for a high fee). If someone really pisses you off without technically doing anything illegal and you feel it is within your character to put a personal bounty on them, then go find the board and place on there. Instructions for doing so, and a list of bounties, are at the bounty board.
