High mortals are allowed to buy property, have houses built, or build special shrines to their god/goddess or sponsor improvements to their god/goddess' temples and so forth.  Businesses don't currently provide income to the player_characters who own them, but still have a RP purpose in terms of prestige and may someday have both income and upkeep costs.  Conversely, currently the only expense is for the initial purchase or any later improvements, which are all negotiated with wizzes.

For those wanting to save up for a place, prices tend to range from 200k to 1m gold.  Location, number of rooms, locks, security, amount of detail, and how expensive it appears are all factors.  You should think in terms of your money going to the builders and whoever they have to hire for whatever you're getting.  Of course only successful adventurers are going to have the means for the luxury of owning property.

If you are high mortal and want to buy existing property and/or have something built, feel free to ask on lines to find a wiz who has the time to work with you.  However, you will still need to mail with a general concept and location to get official approval.  We generally prefer you write your own descriptions, including color and descriptions for items that can be looked at and as much other detail as you can think of.  You can also of course mention features you've seen in other rooms that you would like something similar to.

Guild halls are similar in that guilds require a leader and HC's that are HM, although costs for guild halls are generally even higher.
