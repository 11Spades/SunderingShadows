Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle.
