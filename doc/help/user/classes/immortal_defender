%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^For All Immortal Defenders:

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Class Feats:%^RESET%^
   %^RESET%^L1: defenders presence
   %^RESET%^L4: shield charge
   %^RESET%^L7: shield master

    %^RESET%^And immortal defender is the master of fighting with a weapon
and shield.  They are the immovable front line of any fighting force.  A 
first level immortal defender is able to activate a defenders presence
which will bolster allies in battle, giving them extra vitality to shrug 
off enemy attacks.  Once the immortal defender reaches level four, they 
are able to use a devestating shield charge that will knock attackers 
scattering and can even be used to charge through an enemy lines, making 
room for all who are following the immortal defender in their wake.  
Finally, upon reaching level seven, an immortal defender becomes a master
with their shield.  They are highly resistant to being knocked down while 
using their shield.  The immortal defender also will not loose his melee 
attacks while he is fully defensive using shieldwall.
