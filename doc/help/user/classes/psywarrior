Also known as psychic warriors, psyblades, or psyknights, psywarriors 
are able to turn their mind's potential to the warrior's art. Unlike 
psions, who devote all their energy toward developing their minds, 
psywarriors give equal attention to body and mind, honing their entire
being into a deadly weapon. Most psywarriors favor one weapon type above
all others, but some are adept at wielding various martial implements to 
great effect. Psywarriors thrive on adventure, knowing that only through 
adversity can they grow stronger. Most are fearless, and many relish 
the treasure - monetary, spiritual, or otherwise - that adventuring brings. 

Psywarriors have a cleric's basic combat ability alongside six levels of
psionic powers, making them formidable foes. Like psions, they expend 
their reserve of psychic energy, represented in power points, to manifest
powers spontaneously. Their psionic abilities are based upon their 
intelligence score. 

The psionic gift is unpredictible, and psywarriors may arise from several 
races and from any region, religion, alignment, or background. As a result, 
each individual's reaction to a psywarrior is personal, based on past 
experiences. Psywarriors sometimes face prejudice from those who do 
not trust their unusual mental abilities. Because of this, a few 
isolated societies exist where psions and psywarriors live in peace
and seclusion. Psywarriors that grow up in such a society have been
known to rebel against the strict regimen of commune life. 

Given their innate understanding of both mind and body, psywarriors 
gain one free combat or magic feat every five levels.
