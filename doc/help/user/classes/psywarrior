Also known as psychic warriors, psyblades, or psyknights, psywarriorsare able to turn their mind's potential to the warrior's art. Unlikepsions, who devote all their energy toward developing their minds,psywarriors give equal attention to body and mind, honing their entirebeing into a deadly weapon. Most psywarriors favor one weapon type aboveall others, but some are adept at wielding various martial implements togreat effect. Psywarriors thrive on adventure, knowing that only throughadversity can they grow stronger. Most are fearless, and many relishthe treasure - monetary, spiritual, or otherwise - that adventuring brings.

Psywarriors have a cleric's basic combat ability alongside six levels ofpsionic powers, making them formidable foes. Like psions, they expendtheir reserve of psychic energy, represented in power points, to manifestpowers spontaneously. Their psionic abilities are based upon theirintelligence score.

The psionic gift is unpredictible, and psywarriors may arise from severalraces and from any region, religion, alignment, or background. As a result,each individual's reaction to a psywarrior is personal, based on pastexperiences. Psywarriors sometimes face prejudice from those who donot trust their unusual mental abilities. Because of this, a fewisolated societies exist where psions and psywarriors live in peaceand seclusion. Psywarriors that grow up in such a society have beenknown to rebel against the strict regimen of commune life.

Given their innate understanding of both mind and body, psywarriorsgain one free combat or magic feat every five levels.
