Whether born in the wild or lost to civilization, some find the company of beasts preferable to that of the more intelligent races. A bond of trust and camaraderie is formed over time with the members of their pack, and they eventually are seen as not only a member of the pack, but the alpha member. These individuals, known as Beast Masters possess an unrivaled ability to lead their pack on the hunt, bringing down their foes with a newfound cunning.

Beast Masters begin their careers as rangers and scouts, but soon find their home amongst a pack of their choice.
