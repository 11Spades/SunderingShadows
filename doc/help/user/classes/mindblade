The mindblade is a psion who has dedicated his craft towards
becoming a more effective warrior in melee combat.  He is able
to manifest powers in the heaviest armor and while wielding 
any weapons.  His prescience power is also stronger than that
of a typical psion and has much longer duration.  When the 
mindblade reaches level seven, the true metabolism power becomes
so effect that it will no longer expire over time, but only when
the mindblade is knocked unconscious or killed.
