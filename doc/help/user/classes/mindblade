 %^RESET%^L7: metabolic perfection

The mindblade is a psion who has dedicated his craft towards becoming a more effective warrior in melee combat. He is able to manifest powers in the heaviest armor and while wielding any weapons. His prescience power is also stronger than that of a typical psion and it has much longer duration. When the mindblade reaches level seven, the true metabolism power becomes so powerful that it will no longer expire over time, but only when the mindblade is knocked unconscious or killed.
