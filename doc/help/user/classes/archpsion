The archpsion is the psions what the archmage is to mages. An archpsion has the ability to turn his concentration into stronger spells for short bursts of improved power. Once an archpsion reaches level four, he can also transfer damage from kinetic based attacks directly into power points. Finally, once an archpsion reaches level seven, he is able to concentrate so perfectly on the act of manifesting his powers that sometimes no power points will be used when manifesting.
