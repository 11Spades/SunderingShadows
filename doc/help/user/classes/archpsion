The archpsion is the psions what the archmage is to mages.  An archpsion
has the ability to turn his concentration into stronger spells for short
bursts of improved power.  Once an archpsion reaches level four, he can
also transfer damage from kinetic based attacks directly into power points.
Finally, once an archpsion reaches level seven, he is able to concentrate
so perfectly on the act of manifesting his powers that sometimes no power
points will be used when manifesting.
