A cavalier must be of proper social class and is usually of noble or 
aristocratic origin. A cavalier must always place honor, bravery, and 
personal deeds in the forefront of his or her activity, and must adhere to
a code of conduct and ethics. Upon being sworn to knighthood, a cavalier 
must pledge himself or herself to this code. Failure to sustain the oath 
is sufficient reason to revoke knighthood, according to the lords of the 
realm. Should this happen, the cavalier becomes a mere fighter.

A knight must serve someone or some cause. Cavaliers usually serve a lord
or nobility, or the order of knighthood, while paladins serve a deity. Only
a limited number of faiths permit knights to join their ranks. The gods 
that train cavaliers, and grant divine gifts to paladins, are Auppenser, 
Auril, Bane, Grumbar, Helm, Kelemvor, Kossuth, Lathander, Mystra, Selune, 
Torm, Tyr, Shar, and Sune.

Another characteristic of cavaliers and paladins is the ability to train a
warhorse. As a cavalier grows in power, so will this steed. Simply buy the
horse from a stable or guild hall. Be warned, though, that your warhorse 
will share in your experience should it be used for direct combat.

**NOTE** Before playing a cavalier, be sure to read <help knights>
         You will be expected to follow these guidelines.
