Druids are champions of nature, though they claim no power over it. Instead, a druid's power comes from being one with the natural world, revelling in the awesome destructive power of a storm and finding strength in the gentle rejuvenating potential of a calm pool. Druids are a mixed lot, following the paths of various deities and even holding to diverse truths about the natural world. As such, any two druids may not see eye-to-eye on many matters, including the very essence of nature itself. Many druids prefer to be solitary.

%^CYAN%^Druidic oaths:%^RESET%^ Druids train with natural weapons and armor, and they further take traditional oaths that restrict them from using metal armor. Druids avoid carrying much worked metal at all, believing that it interferes with the pure nature of the wilds. The reasoning behind these oaths depend on the druid's background.

Druids prepare their spells with the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. The %^ORANGE%^<spells druid>%^RESET%^ command will show you every spell available to druids. To cast they use the %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ command. They expend prepared spells from their memory when they cast. They can see currently prepared spells with %^ORANGE%^<recall druid spells>%^RESET%^.

Much like clerics, druids can utilize spontaneous casting of domain spells, however choice of domains they can pick is not defined by their deity. Druids choose one of air, animal, earth, fire, plant, water or storms domains. To learn how to cast domain spells spontaneously refer to %^ORANGE%^<help cast>%^RESET%^.

Druids are versatile and they can take many paths in their lives, becoming powerful spellcasters or preferring a feral life in the shapes of fearsome beasts, or even using their potential for martial combat in their humanoid form.

They can cast in any armour they can wear, but must not wield while casting.
