The Pale Lord is a mortal that persues power of the undeath without willing to sacrifice too much of mortality in his pursuit. The ritual they undergo - either by themselves or with help of another powerful wizard - had been developed just after Nilith's ascention through modification of ritual of becoming the Lich. In this ritual caster's own body serves as partial vessel for the network of spells. Through multiple steps, the body becomes partially transformed into undead state, gaining some of the advantages of unlife. The Pale Lord, however, remains living, and as such must eat, will age, and will die as any mortal.
