%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^The Way of The Shadow%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Those who have dedicated themselves to this emphasis of Ki have learned knowledge of the shadows that goes beyond what most could ever hope. While those who dedicate themselves to studying ki in this way are not inherently evil, they are much more secretive. 

NOTE: 
      Additional Class Skills: Stealth and Perception.
      Way of the Shadow monks receive the following spells: 

      At level 3: darkness, dark vision, and ghost step.      
      At level 7: shadow stride.      
      At level 9: shadow sight.      
      At level 11: cloak of shadows. 
      
      Monks of this dedication who reach level 17 learn to 
      do even more damage with their flurry of blows
      attacks by extending their control of shadows
      and forming tendrils which attack their
      enemies. Mechanically flurry of blows becomes
      'divine' type damage, eventually this will 
      change to likely necrotic.
