The primeval champion is the master of fighting while shapeshifted.
She is able to change into a mighty dragon at first level and attack 
her foes with all the savage ferocity of such a beast.  As fourth 
level, the primeval champion becomes even more deadly while fighting
in form, learning to attack even faster.  Finally when a primeval 
champion reaches level seven she learns to become truely savage, a 
perfect killing machine.  Her attacks become more damaging and she 
heals each time she strikes an opponent.
