The primeval champion is the master of fighting while shapeshifted. She is able to change into a mighty dragon at first level and attack her foes with all the savage ferocity of such a beast. As fourth level, the primeval champion becomes even more deadly while fighting in form, learning to attack even faster. Finally when a primeval champion reaches level seven she learns to become truely savage, a perfect killing machine. Her attacks become more damaging and she heals each time she strikes an opponent.
