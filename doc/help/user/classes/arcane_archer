An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers. They use magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the past centuries, the methods of these elven archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery. To learn these powers one must be familiar with magic of the weave either through The Art, The Power, or gain access to the powers from beyond.
