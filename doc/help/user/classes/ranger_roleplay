Ranger is a diverse class that closely follows paths of nature. 

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Good aligned rangers:%^RESET%^
Rangers of good hearts are the protectors of the woodlands. They seek to 
warn away those who would do harm to the forest and kill out of necessity
rather than desire. They often choose a particular area as their own and 
defend it above all others. They act out of a desire to preserve the peace
found in the wilderness, and as such, they are loathe to cause harm to one
of nature's creatures except in defense of their own lives and even then do
so with a sense of remorse. They harbor no such reservations against 
unnatural creatures such as undead or abominations.

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Neutral aligned rangers:%^RESET%^
Most neutral rangers follow a philosophy very similar to a druid's. They 
see a balance in nature that is missing from the rest of civilization, and
they seek to preserve this balance. Neutral rangers often choose a 
particular wild place of the world, much like good rangers. They usually do
not interfere with what happens there, though, and simply live in that 
place and learn its ways. Neutral rangers see killing as part of nature's 
way, but they do not simply kill for killing's sake.

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Evil aligned rangers:%^RESET%^
Dark-hearted rangers are spoken of, but always in whispers kept well out of
the hearing of other rangers. These are the rangers who have turned aside 
from the role of protector and become blood-thirsty hunters instead. These 
rangers follow many deities, but always revere the darker side of nature 
that produces disease, pain, and death. Such a ranger will sometimes take a
particular area for its own, but in the way that a predatory cat marks out 
its territory. Obviously, these rangers have no qualms about killing, 
maiming, or torturing much of anything. They will occasionally choose a 
particular creature they won't kill for various reasons, but more often 
than not, they choose a particular creature they kill at all costs.
