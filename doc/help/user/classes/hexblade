The Hexblade is a warlock who, through a show of unusual aptitude for physical combat, has earned additional support from their patron in the form of an enhanced warlocks curse and, eventually the ability to summon patron weapons that will serve the hexblade through thick and thin.

Mixing their dark spellcasting with enhanced combat abilities, the hexblade warlock is a foe not to be underestimated. They excel at doing incredible combat damage while weakening their opponent's ability to defend against their relentless assault.
