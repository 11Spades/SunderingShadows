Warmasters are those who have dedicated their lives to the brutal
art of destroying their enemies with huge, two handed weapons.  They
have become so adapt at killing their enemies with large sweeping 
attacks that at first level they no longer have to take time to get
back into position for sweeping blow.  At fourth level their attacks
are so dangerous that weakened enemies have a chance of being
instantly killed if they fail a saving throw against a critical
attack.  At seventh level a warmaster has become gleefully joyous
at the carnage that their large weapon can inflict on the battlefield.
The feats sweeping blow and impale will do more damage.  In addition, 
whenever sweeping blow and impale are used it will inspire the
warmaster to new heights of vigor in battle, restoring some hitpoints
or invigorating health.
