Warmasters are those who have dedicated their lives to the brutal art of destroying their enemies with huge, two handed weapons. They have become so adapt at killing their enemies with large sweeping attacks that at first level they no longer have to take time to get back into position for sweeping blow. At fourth level their attacks are so dangerous that weakened enemies have a chance of being instantly killed if they fail a saving throw against a critical attack. At seventh level a warmaster has become gleefully joyous at the carnage that their large weapon can inflict on the battlefield. The feats sweeping blow and impale will do more damage. In addition, whenever sweeping blow and impale are used it will inspire the warmaster to new heights of vigor in battle, restoring some hit points or invigorating health.
