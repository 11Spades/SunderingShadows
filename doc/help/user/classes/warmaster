Theyhave become so adapt at killing their enemies with large sweeping attacks that at first level they no longer have to take time to getback into position for sweeping blow. At fourth level their attacksare so dangerous that weakened enemies have a chance of beinginstantly killed if they fail a saving throw against a criticalattack. At seventh level a warmaster has become gleefully joyousat the carnage that their large weapon can inflict on the battlefield.The feats sweeping blow and impale will do more damage.
