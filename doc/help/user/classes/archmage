Archmages are mages that have dedicated their lives to the perfection of their craft. They are so well known for their intellect that they are able to make all influence checks with their intelligence, instead of their charisma score. They have honed the art of spellcrafting until very near to perfection. A first level archmage is able to spontaneously cast any prepared school as a school-spell of the same level. At fourth level, an archmage is able to master one of his or her spells of level 5 or below so that it can be cast an unlimited amount of times per day without needing to prepare the spell. Finally, at level seven, an archmage is so adept at casting spells, that he has a chance, based on intelligence, to retain in memory any spells cast.
