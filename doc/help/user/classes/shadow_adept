%^RESET%^Flickering, wavering, dancing between the border of light and darkness, their innate magic is drawn from the dark and gloomy reflection of the Shadow Plane. Perhaps they traveled briefly through a shadow crossing, unknowingly bringing back with themselves a wisp of the starkly colorless Plane of Shadow that is now their inseparable part, or maybe they are just innately in tune with the nature of the Shadow Weave itself. It's been rumored they gained powers from ancient goddess of oblivion, but now she is dead... Who knows. Perhaps someone else took her mantle of control, or mayhaps it floats freely for mystical souls to tap onto.
