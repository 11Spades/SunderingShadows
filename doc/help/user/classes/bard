Bards are great entertainers and tend to be enjoyable companions on an
adventure. They dabble in being flexible in many areas of combat, rather
than being a master of one. They have a rogue's basic combat ability, as
well as six levels of arcane spells, which unlike most casters can be
used spontaneously. Their casting abilities are based upon their charisma
score. They also have the ability to remember and recite <lore> that they
have been told about.

Bards are generally well respected in most settlements, being the bringers
of news from far away lands, the lorekeepers of the realms, and the voice
of many a king or noble to their people and to other cities. They are known
for maintaining a degree of neutrality in most matters. They get by on
their wit and their charm, leaving some to be known as rogueish
troublemakers that are regarded with suspicion.
