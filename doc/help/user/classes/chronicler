A chronicler is a specialized bard, so masterful at embellishing or altering a tale so as to magically make it true. He or she can snatch glimpses of the past and future as though it were part of the present, gaining a greater understanding of history, and hints of what the future brings. Using this insight and his or her own glib storyteller's art, the chronicler can retell the past or future to change time just enough to keep themselves and their allies safe. A chronicler uses her charisma instead of intelligence for all academics checks. At first level, a chronicler learns to see snatches of the future. As the class advances, they extend upon this learning to then manipulate time itself in various ways.
