The barbarian is a fearsome warrior that channels his rage to devastating
effect in battle. Barbarians typically hail from the edge of civilization,
or in some cases, even beyond it. Eschewing the extensive training and
professionalism found commonly among fighters, the barbarian taps into his
primal rage to more than make up for his lack of regimented training.

Strength and constitution are the main attributes of the barbarian. The
higher the barbarian's strength, the better chance he has to hit and damage
his enemy. A high constitution enables the barbarian to withstand more
punishment in the midst of a fray since they are always right in the middle
of every battle they are in. A good dexterity is also recommended to
further allow him to avoid blows during combat.

The barbarian's primary ability in battle is <rage>. Rage increases his
innate strength, constitution, and will saves throughout its duration. This
allows the barbarian to deal and take a great deal of damage, with its
effect and duration increasing as the barbarian gains levels.
