The barbarian is a fearsome warrior that channels his rage to devastatingeffect in battle. Barbarians typically hail from the edge of civilization,or in some cases, even beyond it. Eschewing the extensive training andprofessionalism found commonly among fighters, the barbarian taps into hisprimal rage to more than make up for his lack of regimented training.

Strength and constitution are the main attributes of the barbarian. The higher the barbarian's strength, the better chance he has to hit and damagehis enemy. A high constitution enables the barbarian to withstand morepunishment in the midst of a fray since they are always right in the middleof every battle they are in. A good dexterity is also recommended tofurther allow him to avoid blows during combat.

The barbarian's primary ability in battle is %^ORANGE%^<rage>%^RESET%^. Rage increases hisinnate strength, constitution, and will saves throughout its duration. This allows the barbarian to deal and take a great deal of damage, with itseffect and duration increasing as the barbarian gains levels.
