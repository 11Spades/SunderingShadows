%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION 

Each deity has a small selection of domains that a cleric can choose from, granting them special spells. See %^ORANGE%^<help deities>%^RESET%^ for a list of available deities and their related domains.  

A cleric chooses one domain at level 1 and a second domain at level 11.  At level 21, a cleric may choose a feat that grants access to a third domain (see %^ORANGE%^<help third divine domain>%^RESET%^).  

Rangers will find themselves able to access spells from the animal and plant domains. 

Paladins will find themselves able to access spells from the vigilance and protection domains.
