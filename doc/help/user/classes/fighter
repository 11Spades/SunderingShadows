A trained fighter is perhaps the most diverse class of all. Fighters hail
from all walks of life, following all different codes and ethics, and train
in a diverse array of styles and weapons. As a fighter relies almost 
entirely upon his weapon skills for survival, the principal attribute of a 
fighter is strength, while a good dexterity and constitution are also 
highly desirable. Fighters spend most of their time learning how to use 
weapons of different types, as well as honing their hand-to-hand combat 
skills and self defense abilities.

There are certain abilities granted only to fighters and they are:
   %^ORANGE%^<flash target>%^RESET%^ allows the fighter to perform an acrobatic attack, 
          flipping, dodging or spinning to combat an opponent.  This 
          can be done often and can confuse, or damage an opponent.
   %^ORANGE%^<rescue target>%^RESET%^ This will cause you to move in front of the target and
          try to block the attacks to them, by taking the hits yourself.

Given their exceptional command of martial skill, fighters pick up combat 
abilities at a far greater rate than other classes. They gain one free 
combat feat for every five levels in the class.
