Sorcerers are masters of arcane magic, but in a completely different 
sense to mages.  Where a wizard will study and call upon the weave 
by theory and ritual, sorcerers instead harness raw talent and instinct 
to produce such spell effects.  A typical sorcerer turns to an adventurer's
life to prove and improve their command of the magical arts.  While the 
latent talent is inborn, part of their soul, the development of such 
skill becomes a quest in and of itself for many.  Many sorcerers, both 
good and evil, come to consider themselves above other, lesser mortals 
due to their talents.

Sorcerers prepare themselves by drawing upon their inner strength, but 
do not memorize spells as wizards do. Instead, they may cast spontaneously 
of any spells they know, until they are spent and must prepare themselves 
anew.  While sorcerers are far more capable of enduring lengthy combat, 
as they don't study their art, they lack the diversity of a mage and may 
only cast of a smaller number of known spells (see <help master>).

Given their innate understanding of magic, sorcerers also lend towards 
learning means to improve their art naturally. They gain one free magic 
feat for every five levels in the class.
