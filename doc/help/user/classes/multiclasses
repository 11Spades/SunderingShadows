Multiclasses
============

At every 10th level you will be given the opportunity to multiclass to 
another class or to continue advancing one of your current classes up
in level. You must meet the stat requirements for any new class as well
as any racial or alignment requirements that the new class has. You 
can check the help file for individual classes to learn what all of the
class requirements are.  

Your level in each class will determine the strength of the abilities of 
that class. So while a person with more classes will be more well rounded
and have a variety of abilities to suit a variety of different situations,
a single class character will be more focused and their abilities in their
chosen profession will be considerably stronger.
