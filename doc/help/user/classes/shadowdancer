    %^RESET%^A shadowdancer is a powerful adventurer who has learned not 
only to hide within the shadows, but to actually harness the shadows 
themselves and almost become  part of them. Contrary to popular belief, 
this has little to do with the moral intentions of the shadowdancer; both 
good and evil alike learn to use the shadows in such a manner. Thieves 
are most commonly drawn to this calling, but rangers have also been known 
to have enough natural stealthy aptitude.
