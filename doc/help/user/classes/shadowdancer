%^RESET%^A shadowdancer is a powerful adventurer who has learned not only to hide within the shadows, but to actually harness the shadows themselves and almost become part of them. Contrary to popular belief, this has little to do with the moral intentions of the shadowdancer; both good and evil alike learn to use the shadows in such a manner. Thieves are most commonly drawn to this calling, but rangers have also been known to have enough natural stealthy aptitude.
