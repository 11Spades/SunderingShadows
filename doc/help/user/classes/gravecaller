Gravecallers may come from different backgrounds, but usually they are master necromancers that specialize in channeling negative energy, although it is not unknown that members of other schools and divine casters learning this craft. Gravecaller's stands as a counduit between shadow plane and material world, able to channel many simple necromantic spells at will, but their true stength comes from ability to support their undead allies and servants. Many learn these deepest arcane secrets in their quest for undeath, gaining undead-like traits before their final shift to a state beyond death, some seek ultimate enlightenment in understanding of death, and possess subtle and murderous skills to help them attain it. As studends of death and undeath, they are universally distrusted and feared by the living.
