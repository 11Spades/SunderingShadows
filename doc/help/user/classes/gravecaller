Gravecallers come from different backgrounds of casters of the weave, but usually they are master necromancers that specialize in channeling negative energy, although sometimes members of other schools and divine casters learn this specialization. Gravecaller stands as a counduit between shadow plane and the material world, he is able to channel many necromantic spells at will, but Gravecaller's true stength comes from ability to support their undead allies and servants. Many learn these deepest arcane secrets in their quest for undeath, gaining undead-like traits before their final shift to a state beyond death, some seek ultimate enlightenment in understanding of death, and possess subtle and murderous skills to help them attain it. As studends of death and undeath, they are universally distrusted and feared by the living, while intelligent undead consider them as a threat to their freedom.
