Archmages are mages that have dedicated their lives to the perfection of their craft. They have honed the art of spellcrafting until very near to perfection. A first level archmage gains extended knowledge of his school. At fourth level, an archmage is able to master one of his or her spells of level 5 or below so that it can be cast an unlimited amount of times per day without needing to prepare the spell. Finally, at level seven, an archmage is so adept at casting spells, that he has a chance, based on intelligence, to retain in memory any spells cast.
