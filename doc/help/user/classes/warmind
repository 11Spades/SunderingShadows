Warminds have mastered their awareness of the matter around them. 
They are completely in tune with their own bodies and can make
minute changes to their cells, boosting their performance. This
awareness extends to the world around them, helping them to 
innately understand the physical realm.  Warminds are able to 
flawlessly shape their powers so that they do not harm members
of their own parties.  They are also able to manipulate their own
bodies so that their wounds heal themselves.  Because of their
dedication to perfecting their own bodies, warminds receive
a +2 on all endurance and athletics checks.
