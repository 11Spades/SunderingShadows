Psions and Psywarriors often enter a focused state of mind, which enhances their prowess in combat or offers other passive benefits.

The player can choose to expend their focused state to perform various actions or feats that require you to spend focus.

Some examples of abilities that require you to spend your focus are: Psionic Dodge, Combatprescience, Telekinetic Hurl, and Energy Immunity.

Focus will replenish itself over time or it can be attained by uninterrupted preparation of power points. To show your psionic focus, please type 'help prompt'.
