The Hierophant is an experienced theurgist who is well versed in The Power. They are known for their connection to forces beyond, able to cast more spells with increased potency, while sometimes seemingly never exhausting themselves. Though their spells are weaker than that of archmages, the powers they possess are substantially efficient for combat and peace. At first level they learn of the true power that is the source of their magic. At forth level, they expand their memory in order to retain more spells. And finally, at seventh level they gain the ability to preserve expended spells in their memory.
