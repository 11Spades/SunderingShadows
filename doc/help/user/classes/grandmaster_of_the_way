The Grandmaster of the way is a monk who has dedicated his
life to mastering the various arts of the way.  He is able
to absorb damage from attacks to regenerate a small amount
of ki and he is able to mercifully end the life of opponents
who are sufficiently injured.  Finally at the peak of his
achievement, a grandmaster of the way is able to use all of
the abilities of the way of the fist, the way of the shadow
and the way of the elements.  He does not, however, learn
the skills of the other ways.
