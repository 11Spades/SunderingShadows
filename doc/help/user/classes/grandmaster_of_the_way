The Grandmaster of the Way is a monk who has dedicated his life to mastering the various arts of the Way. He is able to absorb damage from attacks to regenerate a small amount of ki, and he is able to mercifully end the life of an opponent who is sufficiently injured. Finally, at the peak of his achievement, a Grandmaster of the Way is able to use all of the abilities of the Way of the Fist, the Way of the Shadow, and the Way of the Elements. He does not, however, learn the skills of the other ways.
