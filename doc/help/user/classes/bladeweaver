Bladeweavers are the masters of fighting with two weapons at the same time. At level one they are so quick on their feet and they are so good at getting back into position that they are able to use the whirl feat without a delay between rounds. They can still only use one feat at a time, but they no longer need to wait before using it again. When a bladeweaver reaches the fourth level, they have learned to turn their spinning weapons into a formidable defensive force. Their shield of whirling steel makes them much more effective at parrying enemy attacks. Finally at seventh level a bladeweaver is able to frequently counter attack an enemy when he parries an attack.
