Metaminds have mastered control over their minds, making them particularly resilient, especially to attacks against their psyche. After countless hours spent honing their mental prowess, metaminds are able to ignore mind-controlling effects used against them. The metamind is also able to project a portion of himself into the astral plane, granting the timeless body power. A metamind is also so skilled with mental exercises that they gain a +2 to all academics and spellcraft checks.

Metaminds gain passive power point regeneration while focused.
