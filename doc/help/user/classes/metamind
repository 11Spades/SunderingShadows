Metaminds have mastered control over their minds, making them particularly
resilient, especially to attacks against their psyche. After countless 
hours spent honing their mental prowess, metaminds are able to ignore mind
controlling effects used against them.  The metamind is also able to 
project a portion of himself into the astral plane, granting the timeless
body power.  A metamind is also so skilled with mental exercises that they
gain a +2 to all academics and spellcraft checks.
