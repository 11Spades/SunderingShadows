The Hellfire Warlock is a warlock who has taken the additional andperilous step of harnessing the very power of hellfire itself.While this most obviously lends itself to warlocks with infernalpacts, any warlock can potentially seek to wield such power, givenhis existing ability with dark and chaotic arts. Such arts are notconquered lightly; only the hardiest of warlocks can channel suchpower. The results are even more potent and fearsome than those ofmost warlocks; along with a flawless knowledge of the brimstoneessence and a greater endurance to flame and fear, the hellfirewarlock learns to call down hellfire itself upon his foes.
