The Hellfire Warlock is a warlock who has taken the additional and 
perilous step of harnessing the very power of hellfire itself. 
While this most obviously lends itself to warlocks with infernal 
pacts, any warlock can potentially seek to wield such power, given 
his existing ability with dark and chaotic arts. Such arts are not 
conquered lightly; only the hardiest of warlocks can channel such 
power. The results are even more potent and fearsome than those of 
most warlocks; along with a flawless knowledge of the brimstone 
essence and a greater endurance to flame and fear, the hellfire 
warlock learns to call down hellfire itself upon his foes.
