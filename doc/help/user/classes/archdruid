An archdruid has spent his life mastering the flow of nature through
the world around him. He becomes so in tune with the natural world that
he is able to channel it with near perfection. At first level an archdruid
is able to take the form of an elemental and gain some powers that an
elemental of the corresponding element would have. At fourth level an
archdruid has learned some spells so well that she can cast them without
needing to prepare them in advance and can cast them an unlimited amount
of times per day. At seventh level, an archdruid has become so in sync
with the natural world that she has a chance, based on her wisdom score,
to retain in memory any spells that she casts.
