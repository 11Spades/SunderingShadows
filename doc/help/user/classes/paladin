Paladins are the protectors of their chosen patron in the realm of 
ShadowGate. They are cavaliers selected by their faith to battle their 
enemies and uphold their charge. A paladin's purpose varies according to
theiry patron's charge, but protection and law are always part of their 
code of honor.

A knight must serve someone or some cause. Cavaliers usually serve a lord
or nobility, or the order of knighthood, while paladins serve a deity. Only
a limited number of faiths permit knights to join their ranks, where lawful
clergy are accepted. Paladins are granted a subset of divine spells based 
on their wisdom score, as well as the ability to turn undead.

Another characteristic of cavaliers and paladins is the ability to train a
warhorse. As a cavalier grows in power, so will this steed. Simply buy the
horse from a stable or guild hall. Be warned, though, that your warhorse 
will share in your experience should it be used for direct combat.
