Paladins are the protectors of their chosen patron in the realm of ShadowGate. They are holy (or unholy) warriors selected by their faith to battle their enemies and uphold their charge. A paladin's purpose varies according totheiry patron's charge, but protection and law are always part of their oaths.

A paladin serves someone or some cause. They serve a lord or nobility, or the order of knighthood, or a higher power directly, like deity. Only faiths with lawful clergy have required degree of order to induct a paladin.

Paladins are granted a subset of divine utility spells based on their wisdom score, including spell to summon a powerful mount. You can see their spell list with %^ORANGE%^<spells paladin>%^RESET%^.
