A warlock is a being whose soul is suffused with perilous magic, whetherby willing or unwilling means. They do not approach magic through themedium of spells, much as a mage or sorcerer might. Instead, they caninvoke magic through simply an act of will, resulting in a limited butpowerful array of magical aids, trickery, and powerful blasts of eldrichpower. While these effects are not spells, as spell-like abilities theyare subject to most of the same factors, and benefit from most of thesame feats and other empowerments, unless otherwise specified. Giventheir simple somatic attributes, warlock invocations can be cast in lightarmor.

Warlocks use %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn their invocations. Then they can just %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ any invocation they know at any time they want.

Warlocks can cast in light armor, but they can't do so while wielding normal weapons. However, they can cast while wielding weapons they have summoned.

Warlocks have a degree of versatility and can take both martial and spellcasting paths.
