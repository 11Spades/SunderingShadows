A warlock is a being whose soul is suffused with perilous magic, whetherby willing or unwilling means. They do not approach magic through themedium of spells, much as a mage or sorcerer might. Instead, they caninvoke magic through simply an act of will, resulting in a limited butpowerful array of magical aids, trickery, and powerful blasts of eldrichpower. While these effects are not spells, as spell-like abilities theyare subject to most of the same factors, and benefit from most of thesame feats and other empowerments, unless otherwise specified. Giventheir simple somatic attributes, warlock invocations can be cast in lightarmor.

Warlocks are the champions or conduits of dark or chaotic powers. They,or sometimes their ancestors, share a bloodline or have forged a pactwith a powerful planar entity, often trading a piece of their soul inexchange for the supernatural abilities they can invoke. Many surrenderto a desire for power in making such a pact, while some seek to escapethe wrongs of their past or ancestors. Yet others may be bound topatrons of chaos rather than evil, though such powers are no lessdangerous for their unpredictable designs. Those with a heritage of suchpower are not necessarily planetouched or half-planar, as the mark leftbehind is upon the soul rather than the flesh.

Most warlocks are viewed with at least suspicion by most civilizedspecies, given the dangerous powers to which they are bound. They areoften drawn to the life of an adventurer, whether that be to further thedesigns of their patrons, or to gain the strength to resist them. Whilethe powers that bind them can be cruel or capricious, even warlocks whoderive their power from the most sinister of patrons have been known toturn their dark powers against evil. Even the brightest of souls maywield such power, for certainly the familiarity with the darkness theycall upon allows them to gaze unflinchingly upon even the most terrifyingof foes.
