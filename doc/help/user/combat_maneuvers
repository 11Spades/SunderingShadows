%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Usage: Passive%^RESET%^

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Some manuevers in combat require a check to determine their success. This pits the attacker's Combat Maneuever Bonus (CMB) against the victim's Combat Maneuver Defense(CMD). Combat maneuver checks are used mainly for actions which are not attacks to perform damage but are meant to disarm/trip/sunder or perform some other debilitating condition on the victim. The calculation for combat maneuvers is as follows:

CMB = Base Attack + Strength Bonus + Size Modifier
CMD = Base Attack + Strength OR Dexterity Bonus + Size Modifier

(*Size Modifier is as follows - Small: -1, Medium: 0, Large: +1)
(*Small creatures will use DEX for CMB instead of STR)

Maneuver Attack Calulation = d20 + CMB VS 10 + CMD

Any class can attempt a combat maneuver, but some classes through feats or class bonuses will be naturally better than others.
