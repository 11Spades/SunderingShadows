The command introduce is a special emote that can be 
used to introduce yourself to the room.  The logic behind 
this is that your name will always sound the same, no 
matter what language you are speaking or whether or not 
the people around you understand your language.  This is 
the ONLY exception to the rule of not using emotes to get 
around language barriers.

Syntax: introduce as <name>
