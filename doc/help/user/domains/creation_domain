Drawing upon the powers of conjuration, the creation 
domain is quite useful, producing everything from common 
goods to wards of protection that are difficult to bypass.  
In addition, the domain may also create a particularly 
powerful spell to harm foes.

The creation domain contains the following spells:
Minor Creation (1st), Glyph of Warding (4th), and Cometfall (7th)
