%^BOLD%^-=%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Good Domain%^WHITE%^=-%^RESET%^

Drawing fully upon the forces of pure good, this domain blesses 
those of like hearts while harming most those who are directly 
opposite in beliefs.  However, the spells involved will still 
affect those even of the same alignment.  Most spells will only 
work for a priest of good alignment.

The good domain contains the following spells:
Bless (1st), Holy Orb (5th), and Holy Word (7th)
