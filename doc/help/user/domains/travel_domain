Those with the travel domain are masters of motion, as little as moving themselves from one room to the next without doors to as impressive as creating a portal through which to transport an entire group.

Clerics with the Travel Domain will only use half as much stamina as others when walking the world.

The travel domain contains the following spells:

Skate, Clairvoyance, Faithful Mount, Dimension Door, Teleport, Pass Portal, Create Portal, Phase Door, Astral Projection
