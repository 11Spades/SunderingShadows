Concerned with the realm of the dead, the repose 
domain allows the caster to access certain powers 
from Kelemvor's plane.  Like Kelemvor himself, 
the domain does not in any way use souls trapped 
here.

The repose domain contains the following spells:
Phantom Steed (3rd), Spectral Touch (5th), Ghostform (8th)
