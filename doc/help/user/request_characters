%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^HM request characters

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^There are several races and subraces that are restricted from standard play. These are usually character types that only experienced players can play effectively, and/or ones that we wish to keep at low numbers due to their rare occurrence. They are restricted %^YELLOW%^only to high-mortals%^WHITE%^, as much as for reward for their efforts, as for their difficulty to play by only the most experienced players. Many of these races are subject to specific stat adjustments and/or racial abilities.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^To request one of these character types, an avatarmail must be submitted with basic character concept, personality, and a sufficiently detailed background. This will be put to an immortal vote to decide its suitability, and then given approval or denial when possible (this takes approximately a week, give or take some time due to immortal availability). Please only put forward realistic ideas, as ones put forward merely for "cool factor" will just be ignored. Keep racial standards in mind (eg/ dwarves and halflings have little to no arcane ability; elves have no affinity for psionics, etc).

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Be aware that many of the specialty races/subraces are on restricted numbers, to avoid mass numbers of what should be rare races. In these cases, players may need to apply at a later time to play such a character, if too many have already been approved for play. Further races are still under consideration, and may be added to this list at a later date. The lists below detail what can be requested, and by what kind of player.

%^YELLOW%^-specialty races (drow, half-drow)
%^YELLOW%^-demihuman specialty subraces (svirfneblin, duergar, wild elf)
%^YELLOW%^-human planetouched races (tiefling, aasimar, genasi)
%^YELLOW%^-non-standard alignment characters (evil gnomes, good goblins, etc)
%^YELLOW%^-non-standard class/race combinations (dwarven knight, halfling bard, etc)
