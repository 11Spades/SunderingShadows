The following commands help anyone communicate:
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^    tell    say    yell    reply%^RESET%^

Type %^ORANGE%^<help %^ULINE%^COMMAND%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^>%^RESET%^ to find out more about each.
Do not type the %^ORANGE%^<>%^RESET%^ or %^ORANGE%^COMMAND%^RESET%^.
    %^ORANGE%^<>%^RESET%^ means what is enclosed is the command.
    %^ORANGE%^COMMAND%^RESET%^ means that you do not use the word command literally, but substitute the appropriate command name. See %^ORANGE%^<help help>%^RESET%^ about this syntax.

In addition, there are a number of 'lines' available to help aid communication.

%^MAGENTA%^What is a 'line'?%^RESET%^

A line is a communication channel, which allows you to chat with the other players and immortals (staff members) on the game. To use a line you type %^ORANGE%^<%^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^LINENAME%^RESET%^ %^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^MESSAGE%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^>%^RESET%^. E.g to ask a question on the 'newbie' line you might type:

newbie How do I train to use my sword better?

If a character called Bumblebore were to type that, everyone who had access to the newbie line would see:

%^BLUE%^[%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^newbie%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^] %^GREEN%^< %^BOLD%^Bumblebore%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^> %^ORANGE%^How do I train to use my sword better?%^WHITE%^

If you see a 'someone' in place of the character name on a line message, that means that the person who is speaking is an immortal, one of the administrators of the game. Please pay attention to what they say; the immortals are in charge of the game.

%^MAGENTA%^What lines are there?%^RESET%^

The lines that are available to players include:

%^ORANGE%^newbie%^RESET%^
    The best line to ask basic questions about the game.

%^ORANGE%^question%^RESET%^
    All other generic questions about the game, mechanics and roleplay should go here.

%^ORANGE%^ooc%^RESET%^
    General ooc chatter. You might want to disable this line if you prefer more immersive environment.

%^ORANGE%^inform%^RESET%^
    General communication line, usually available to everyone who is logged in at the time. As a courtesy to the other players, this line is best used sparingly, to avoid interrupting everyone's game. See if you can find the information you need in a help file or faq before asking here. You are allowed to use this line to make party requests. Type %^ORANGE%^<help line use>%^RESET%^ for more information on how to do this.

%^ORANGE%^discuss%^RESET%^
    A line sometimes used by immortals to discuss issues with players. You will only have access to this line if an immortal has deliberately brought you onto the line.

Type %^ORANGE%^<lines>%^RESET%^ to see all lines available to you.

To disable/enable a line just type its name without an argument.
