Character Age on ShadowGate

%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION%^RESET%^

Characters can choose from 4 different age categories on ShadowGate.  Your actual age in years will depend on your race.  Humans are considered adult at age 18, for example, while goblins reach adulthood at age 13.  On the other extreme, elves are only considered adult at at about 120.  Whatever your age in years, note that your character %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^must%^RESET%^ be portrayed as an %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^adult member%^RESET%^ of that race. 

See the individual race help files for specifics: %^ORANGE%^<help %^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^RACE%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^>%^RESET%^.

As the years pass, your character will age and have his/her age category change.  On ShadowGate, age takes a toll on your body but sharpens your wits.  The following changes are cumulative and will be made to your character's attributes (stats) when he or she reaches that category: 

  <>  Normal(adult): No change
  <>  Middle Age:    -1 str/dex/con and +1 int/wis/cha
  <>  Old Age:       -2 str/dex/con and +2 int/wis/cha
  <>  Venerable:     -3 str/dex/con and +3 int/wis/cha
   
When you create a new character, you will have the option of selecting any of these age categories. The game will choose an appropriate number within that category.  Should you not be happy with your chosen age, you can reset it using a device given to you upon creation.  This device is only accessible to you while you are still a newbie.
