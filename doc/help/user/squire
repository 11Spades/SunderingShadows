In order for a Knight to become recognized by his or her faith and the realms as a Paladin, he or she must first complete a squiring process to an established Paladin.

The squiring process enables Knights to learn the finer points of serving their cause and to earn the chance for greater responsibility.  A Squire is a personal servant of the Lord or Lady overseeing his or her training, and as such he or she will be expected to do the Lord's or Lady's bidding.  This is an opportunity for the Squire to prove his or her dedication to the knightly virtues and the Knight's code.  Read <help knights> to see an explanation of the code.

The squiring process is not simply a formality.  We expect that it will be RP'd fully and at length.  The squiring process can take on average anywhere between 4 and 6 weeks, during which you are actively RPing as a Squire.

The relationship between the Squire and his or her Lord or Lady places responsibility on both of them.

It is the Paladin's responsibility to ensure that the Squire has proven himself or herself worthy of the honor of Paladinhood.  To do this, the Paladin could set a series of tasks or quests appropriate to the Squire's code to assess the Squire in different situations.

It is the Squire's responsibility to prove himself or herself worthy.  Advancing to Paladinhood is dependent upon the RP of this relationship and process. 
By the end of this process, the Squire must have a written charge that outlines the Squire's beliefs and the guidelines for the Squire's behavior upon becoming a Paladin.  The charge does not have to be poetic, but it does have to be binding.

Although Cavaliers are not required to become Paladins, we encourage those who wish to remain Cavaliers to seek out a mentor as well.  Cavaliers should at least write and avatarmail the charge they intend to follow.

If you enter into a relationship either as the Squire or the Mentor, make an avatarmail and include:
-- The names of the characters involved
-- What your position in the arrangement is
-- When the agreement was entered into
-- The charge that the Squire will follow upon becoming a Paladin
-- Any other information that you feel is important about the agreement

NOTE:  If you are unable to find someone to Squire under but you would like to, make an avatarmail outlining your situation and we will accommodate you either via a PC or NPC.
