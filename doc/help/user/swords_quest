Advanced Player Quest aka Quest for the Swords
=================

Once you reach level 19, you will be required to complete this quest in order to advance.  The quest begins in a main city, in a room with an NPC you need to find.  There is more than one quest available and you will be assigned one when you begin.  As with all quests, do NOT just ask someone and do what they did.  With this one, however, that abuse is even more likely to result in failure even without a wiz or avatar noticing it.
