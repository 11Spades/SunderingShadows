%^C159%^All seasons serve a purpose but it is Winter in particular that has drawn some druids' attention and together they belong to the Circle of Winter. The circle concerns itself with how everything that grows and flourishes will eventually die, and everything that lives on the Prime Material, lives under this cycle of life and death, of living and dying. The seasons together, and all life, create the balance with which life continues, from the end at cold death that then transitions to renewal in spring, as new life blossoms. Old wanes as ew grows and flourishes, as everything is naturally balanced anew.%^CRST%^
