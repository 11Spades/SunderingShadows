Circle of Wildfire
A druid that may feel themselves aligned with wildfire would commonly be known to belong to the Circle of Wildfire and concern themselves with safeguarding the spread of natural flames and their place within the natural order. Commonly they agree that all natural fires are beneficial, while the use of all other fires must be controlled so as to bring no harm to the balance in which fires dwell within nature.

Anathemas:
Natural fires make room for something new to nourish. Where natural flames once ravaged, new life has come to blossom. Preventing natural fires from spreading or happening is anathema to you.

The uncontrolled and destructive use of unnatural fire leads to wastefulness and overconsumption, throwing the delicate balance of a blossoming forest unnaturally from its order. The uncontrolled or irresponsible use of fire is anathema to you.

Fire bears a great power, as even the fundamental lessons of every civilization relies on fire and the use of fire. Fire can be a protective shield, as much as a powerful tool against those who would harm nature. Fire warms in the depths of winter, and allows for food to nourish more. The use of fire towards anything that does not nourish or benefit nature is anathema to you.
