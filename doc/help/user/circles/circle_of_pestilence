%^C084%^Nature holds a place for diseases and certain "filth", as the civilised races would call them. The druids that concern themselves specifically with this prospect are known as the Circle of Pestilence. They devote themselves to ensuring that diseases continue to spread and that even the smallest of insects, rodents and even the most devastating disease do little more than to maintain the delicate natural balance.%^CRST%^

%^C060%^Anathemas:%^CRST%^
%^C084%^Diseases are a natural part of the rule of the strong, only those strong enough can survive them and nature sorts those too weak out with diseases. Healing or curing any disease, or tolerating anyone to be curing one, is anathema to you.%^CRST%^

%^C084%^Insects make up a vital part of nature, from pesky mosquitos to rodents and spiders, they serve in the natural food chain as much as rodents and spiders control that there is never too much. Killing rodents or insects indiscriminately, or tolerating someone else to do so, is anathema to you.%^CRST%^

%^C084%^The effect of diseases on the world and its natural order can never be denied. Where there were too many living in one place, a disease proves powerful enough to topple even the most vast power imaginable. Downplaying the importance of diseases or failing to recognize that they always win out is anathema to you.%^CRST%^
