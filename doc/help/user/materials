materials

Materials are the components used to make items such as jewelry,
weapons clothing or armor. Mainly they are used by nwps allowing
players to create master pieces. Any given material has a type,
such as "metal", a specific type, such as "titanium", and a quantity.
You can combine materials with the same type and specific type. Note
that when doing so you will assume the lowest quality, so combining
Excellent with low will result in low.
