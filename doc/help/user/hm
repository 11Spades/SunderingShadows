%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ High mortal help for ShadowGate
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^====================================

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^High mortals on ShadowGate are elected to that position.  High mortals ultimately have a large role in determining the direction of the mud and the direction of immortal efforts.  They also receive a limited set of supplementary commands.  Only hms can start guilds, hold city positions, or own/build property (see help houses).

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^A high mortal is recommended by a wiz, avatar, high mortal or fellow player. These recommendations and the final decision by immortals are based upon the following criteria.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Contribution - %^WHITE%^has this person been on SG long enough to warrant this status? Have they made a difference to the Shadowgate community by their presence? Are they dedicated to this as their main or only character? Generally the minimum allowable time is at least 15 days played, though most players have more than this before they find themselves ready to progress to HM status.  Players may only have one HM-rank character at a time (other characters must be demoted to AP to make way for a rise of the current character to HM status).

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Trust -------- %^WHITE%^This level of trust is compulsory before obtaining HM status, and given the lesser restrictions will usually be gained before the player is considered for HM.  High mortals are supposed to be an example of the best players, both ICly and OOCly, that our game has to offer, so we expect them to lead by example.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Roleplay ----- %^WHITE%^This encompasses three important aspects:
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^-quality: %^WHITE%^Does this person play the role they chose on creation? Can other players guess at this person's alignment? (remember - law and chaos as well, not just good and evil). Do they play their class and race appropriately (eg/ does the mage play that longterm learning of arcanery, or just hand out cheap scrolls?). Do they have strengths and weaknesses to enhance their character? Do they have a background that gives a strong basis for their origins and motivations?
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^-consistency: %^WHITE%^Do they have a strong standard of RP all the time? Or are they only good one day, and mundane the next? 
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^-initiation: %^WHITE%^HMs are second only to avatars in making things happen on the mud. Does this person instigate interesting roleplay when they enter the room, or do they wait for someone else to do so?  Also, do they begin roleplay with everyone, or do they stick only to their small group of friends and allies?

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Renown ------- %^WHITE%^Is this character a renowned personality known through out the realms? Have they accomplished many great deeds? Is their name at the tip of everyone's tongue? Is that renown appropriate for their alignment/stats/class/etc.? A low charisma thief probably isn't going to be known as a great leader of men, for example, but may be well known for many other reasons.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^You may recommend yourself for HM status if you feel that your character has sufficient strength in parts of the above list. If you are recommending another character for HM, this should include specific examples of the role you see them playing and how you feel they meet the criteria. You may not know their stats or alignment (and certainly shouldn't ask them), but you can tell us if they come across as wise, smart, charismatic, evil, lawful, etc. and what makes you think of them that way. Immortals will consider those along with reviewing what we have seen and noted as well as often ask the player some questions before making a decision, or put the player forward for review by other existing HMs.
