Turn undead is an ability useable by clerics and paladins only.
By using the command "turn undead" you attempt to destroy all the undead
monsters that are in the room with you. The ability can only be used once
per monster and you will not get experience for turning them as you would
have for killing them. Some undead are immune to this, others merely have
degrees of resistance that are based on their level and yours, and whatever
other natural resistances they might have.
