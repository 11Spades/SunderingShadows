Adds a description that people will see when they look at you. The 
description is shown in the form of "your name + text". For example, if 
I type <describe is a blue-eyed elf.>, then my description will read 
"Joe is a blue-eyed elf.".  If no argument is given, then you will 
see your current description.  If the argument -remove or -Remove is
used then you will clear your description. 

Descriptions past a certain point of play are required, but you are 
strongly encouraged to come up with one as soon as possible before
you are forced to.  Poor descriptions that have been obviously entered to
simply fulfill the requirement to level are not allowed.  You must
adhere to the guidelines below in determining your description.
Your description should also be at a very minimum 2 sentences, and when
deciding what you look like you should also defer to your race and charisma
to guide you.
 
Please keep in mind that a description and adjectives are the means by
which you describe your *physical* appearance to people.  Stick to the
facts, and do not add opinions.  If you were to walk up to me in the
street, you would not be able to tell if I was strong or evil or good. 
If you want people to come to a conclusion about you, you need to
describe things about yourself factually.  If you want to look evil,
then perhaps you should say that you are sneering or, even better, say
that your face has wrinkles from sneering.  Do not try and tell the
player what they should think about you.
 
Do not mix up opinions with facts.  You can be a "muscular dwarf" 
character, but don't try and tell a firbolg that he should consider you 
"strong". To him, you're nothing special.  The same thing with beauty, 
or alignment.  Make sure and think like a character would, not as you, 
the human player.  
 
Next, descriptions are not your history.  That is what your background 
is for.  Besides the fact that it is the wrong thing to do, putting your 
history in your describe gives an advantage to other players as to how 
to act regarding you.  If you are a con-artist and are talking to 
someone and he sees that you describe yourself as evil, then how are you 
going to trick them into a con game? 
 
Finally, your ability to do something is not a description.  There is no 
activity that should be put in a description.  Phrases like 
"...suddenly he turns and sees you," or "She sees straight into your 
soul" are wrong.  Are you a robot that always turns around when a person 
looks at you?  No.  Do you have a magical spell that allows you to look 
into souls instantly?  No.

If for some reason your character is quite different than normal from your
race you need to have a good, and valid, reason for the changes. "I don't
know" and "I'm just a freak" or blaming it on genetics are not valid reasons.
