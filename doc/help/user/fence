Fencing:

Thieves and bards have the ability to steal items and gold, through past 
experience exp can not be directly gained from the use of these skills.
The ability to fence is a way for thieves to actually begin using the
thieving skills effectively and gain the experience they deserve. 

In each thief's guild there will be a fence. That fence will look
much like a shop keeper. Except you will be able to <launder amount gold>.
Only gold you've stolen can be laundered. You will be able to <fence item>.
Only items you've stolen can be fenced. You will get some amount of the 
value back. It will be put into your thief account. This will be credit
usable at a thief store. So say you have stolen 1000 gold and laundered it
and the fence has given you 50% credit. That means you have 500 gold on 
account. You can then use that to purchase things from the fences store.
Items fenced will appear over time back in stores. So thieves are
encouraged to use these accounts to get rare items. You will also receive
exp for money you launder and items you fence. This is mostly level
relative. However, difficulty is taken into consideration. Also
note that as a fence gets to know you better, their fees drop. So the more
you steal the more you get...
