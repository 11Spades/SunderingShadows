%^CYAN%^FADE TO BLACK%^RESET%^

If you are uncomfortable in a RP situation, consider whether it is possible for your character to remove themselves from the situation and allow others to continue. If this is not an option you may, at any time and for any reason, call a fade to black. Other players and immortals must comply and immediately end the current scene.

Once a fade to black call is made players and immortals (if applicable) should discuss the situation OOC and agree on the outcome of the RP: 
	What happened?
	What are the results? 
  How should your characters perceive each other in the future?
  
When discussing the outcome of a fade to black, always remember:

  In a PK, the victim may always choose death over debilitating long term effects such as loss of limbs, etc.
  Any scene sexual in nature must have OOC consent, regardless of a fade to black. If there is no OOC consent, the scene cannot happen. The players should come up with an alternative solution and go from there.
  
If a fade to black call is not respected, contact the staff. If a staff member is not available, you can quit the game and contact LAW at %^ORANGE%^admin@sunderingshadows.com%^RESET%^ or via %^ORANGE%^<lawmail>%^RESET%^ in game.
