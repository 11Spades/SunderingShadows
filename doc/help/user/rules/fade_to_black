%^CYAN%^FADE TO BLACK%^RESET%^

A 'Fade to black' is used where one or more parties are not comfortable roleplaying through a situation that may arise.

While torture, and some other adult situations are legal on this mud, with exceptions mentioned int the rules, it is entirely optional to players if they choose to roleplay through these. 'Fade to black' is the alternative should any player not wish to roleplay them. In such a case, a player can request a fade to black. This is a purely OOC%^RESET%^ clause and you may use emotes or lines to convey the request, should in-game speech prove problematic.

A fade to black effectively omits the roleplay of a situation, but does not%^RESET%^ negate that it has happened IC%^RESET%^ly. The situation has still happened to all characters involved, and any reactions or fallout should be roleplayed appropriately afterwards. Usually the aggressor of the situation will explain in OOC%^RESET%^ terms what has happened, and roleplay will pick up again from after the event has occurred.

Should any player request a fade to black and not have this acknowledged by other players, they are welcome to quit out of the situation and should %^ORANGE%^<avatarmail>%^RESET%^ or contact lawgroup at a later time so staff members are aware of the reason for quitting out of an IC%^RESET%^ situation. This is as an exception to the rule where it is illegal to quit out of a PK%^RESET%^ situation, as no player is entitled to force another to roleplay a potentially traumatic experience.

Fade to black should NOT%^RESET%^ be used to avoid a situation simply because you do not feel like roleplaying it, or because you wish to avoid repercussions to your character, as your character will still need to deal with any repercussions of the event itself. It should ONLY%^RESET%^ be used in situations where roleplaying the event through will cause discomfort to the player on the other side of the screen.

Note that certain situations mentioned in the rules can't be roleplayed a priori within the mud.
