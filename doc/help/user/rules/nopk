%^CYAN%^THE NOPK FLAG%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^New characters that are of a standard race have a %^WHITE%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ that protects them from aggressive characters.%^RESET%^
To opt into PK (player killing), turn the flag off (<help set>). When you turn this flag off, you signal to the player-base that you are ready to engage in hostile roleplay.

While under the protection of a %^WHITE%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^, you may not take any antagonistic actions towards other players. If someone provokes you, it is your responsibility to back out of a hostile situation or turn your %^WHITE%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^ off. If a conflict starts in your room, you must leave. 
If you have opted %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^into PK%^RESET%^, you may not purposefully antagonize a character with an active %^WHITE%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^, or attempt to pull them into a hostile situation. You may however threaten them if provoked (<help threaten>) and otherwise roleplay in accordance with your character.

%^CYAN%^PK RACES%^RESET%^
Some races, known as advanced races or PK races, have their NOPK flag turned of at creation. These races can be identified by the red warning in the race help file (<help RACE>) and should also be listed in <help races>. If your characterâ€™s race changes for any reason, you are considered a PK race if either race (old or new) is a PK race. 

%^CYAN%^ANTAGONISTIC ACTIONS%^RESET%^
Antagonistic actions are defined as any action that purposely provokes or annoys another character. Note that antagonistic does not equal villainous. If you witness a crime as a NOPK character, you are not allowed to act on that information if doing so would inconvenience the perpetrator. You are, however, allowed to send up a pkmail/avatarmail alerting us of the event.

Examples of antagonistic actions include but are not limited to: Verbal insults or threats, snitching, breaking city laws, emoting offensive actions, invasion of privacy, stealing from other players, scrying, being in a shapeshifted form, bringing an animal into a civilized area, and using dangerous, harmful and/or disruptive spells/abilities. The race of a character can only be considered provocation if it is of a PK race (see above).

%^CYAN%^NOPK AFTER PK%^RESET%^
Characters that die in PK are given a temporary NOPK flag, even if they are of a PK race. When under the protection of this flag, you must follow the rules outlined above, in addition to those found in <help post pk>. Remember that it is %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^your%^RESET%^ responsibility to avoid hostile situations while you have the flag: Stay away from known enemies and areas where your presence may lead to conflict, and back out of any potentially hostile situation.
