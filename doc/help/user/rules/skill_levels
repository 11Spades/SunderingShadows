%^CYAN%^SKILL LEVELS

%^MAGENTA%^To help you roleplay your skills on Sundering Shadows, we have written the following guidelines.%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^General%^RESET%^
Your total points in a skill determines your prowess with said skill. See <skills> for how to apply them. In general, a maxed-out skill will give you a good chance of success in areas appropriate to your level, or vs players of a similar level. Likewise, a less than maxed-out out skill will lower your chances of success in such areas/instances.

%^CYAN%^Crafting%^RESET%^
Crafting skills are rolled against a DC dependent on the level of the item, which again is determined by how many bonuses the item has. Mundane items can generally be fixed with a total skill of ca. 10, while enchanted items require a maxed-out skill. Similarly, you can craft a masterwork item with a skill of 10-15, but enchanting gear with the craft magical equipment requires you to invest solely in that craft skill. 

%^CYAN%^Roleplaying your skills%^RESET%^
As a general guideline, you can use the following skill levels to determine your aptitude in that particular skill. Note that these are based on what a lvl 50 character can feasabily reach. As you level your character, you can roleplay learning your skills and being reasonably good at any maxed-out skill (for your level, that is.) As an example, consider Daryl the bard with a 30 influence at level 25. He is reasonably adapt at bluffing and persuading others, and may easily woo the common folk. However, when trying to bluff Tara, the level 50 cleric with a 60 perception, Daryl comes up short. 

At level 50, you can use the following table to determine your ability with a skill:

Dismal      0-9    This field is your weakness, you are very poor at this skill, or barely know it exists.
Untrained   10-19  You have little to no knowledge of/skill in this field.
Novice      20-29  You are a beginner student in this field, or have picked up some general pointers.
Proficient  30-39  You have working/theoretical knowledge of this field and are fairly competent at it.
Expert      40-49  You are a master of this field and can impress others with your prowess.
Legend      50-59  The best of the best, your skill in this field is how legends are born.
Mythical    60+    Your mythical knowledge/skill in this field is beyond that of most mortals.
