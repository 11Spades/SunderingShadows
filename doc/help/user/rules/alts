%^CYAN%^PLAYING MULTIPLE ALTS ON SUNDERING SHADOWS%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^We understand that you may want to play multiple characters (aka alts) to enjoy the game. However, having multiple alts involved on multiple sides of a conflict can be confusing and create an unfair advantage, or the perception of an unfair advantage. In order to keep it fun and fair for everyone, we have written the following alt guidelines:

%^CYAN%^Ground rules%^RESET%^

    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ You may only have one alt logged on at any given time. 
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ You may not transfer anything between your alts in any way.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Your alts cannot know each other. If one alt permanently retires, you may request creating a new alt that is related to your old one. 
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ You may not have two (or more) alts directly involved on two (or more) sides of a conflict. 
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ If one of your alts is involved in a PK, you must play that alt exclusively for the next seven days, until the situation has been resolved, or until it is killed in a PK.

%^CYAN%^Avatar Plots%^RESET%^

Only one of your alts can participate actively in an ongoing avatar plot. Your other alts can discuss events in general terms with publicly available information, but should avoid getting involved. If you need to change which alt is active in the plot, mail the avatar in question and request a change.

If you have contacted the avatars with a personal request for your alt, we ask that you do not send up requests for different alts until the aforementioned request has been resolved. If you wish to abandon your request and play a new character, please let us know.

%^CYAN%^Designated Main%^RESET%^

The character that you are currently devoting the majority of your time to, is often referred to as a main, or a designated main. If you wish to designate one of your characters as your main, you can do so in your PC-notes. This helps avatars manage their time better, so that they can focus on the same characters as you are.

%^CYAN%^Player Conflict and PK%^RESET%^

If one of your alts is involved in a PK, you must play that alt exclusively for the next seven days, until the situation has been resolved, or until it is killed in a PK. We further ask that none of your other alts be directly involved with characters that are participating in the situation. Your character can discuss events, but should avoid aiding or abetting either side.
