%^CYAN%^DEATH%^RESET%^

When die, you will have a chance to choose a church to return to. To rejoin the living, you need to first pick a church from a list (temples of the gods/goddesses are not included and newbies will always go to Offestry). Once there, you %^ORANGE%^<pray>%^RESET%^ or %^ORANGE%^<return>%^RESET%^ to get a new body. You will be barely alive and still need healing. You may want to choose the church nearest where you died, although you may also want to simply return to a city where you have funds and know you can buy kits and begin repairing your items rather than risk returning to the place you just died.

Returning to life at churches comes at a price:

%^CYAN%^1.%^RESET%^ Loosing some experience. If you die, you loose some experience, a portion of experience amount needed to gain the next level. How much is lost exactly depends on your level.
%^CYAN%^2.%^RESET%^ Deterioration of enchanted items. In other words, all magical equipment will become severely damaged.

%^CYAN%^%^ULINE%^Item deterioration%^RESET%^

All your enchanted equipment will be damaged, and in some cases almost unsuable, although passing the veil will never destroy an item. You can try to repair your items yourself if you have the skills for it (help skills). Or you can visit the vendors and pray to have them repair your equipment. Weapon vendors repair weapons. Armor vendor repair armors, and so forth. Some vendors have workshop to repair everything. It is not recommended to explorer in damaged gear. Damaged weapons will deal less damage, and damaged armor will offer less protection.

%^CYAN%^%^ULINE%^Dying in parties%^RESET%^

Suriving party members often have means to resurrect you on the spot. Such restoration has no price, but you might want to prepare yourself for immediate combat. It highly recommended that parties decide in advance where they will re-group if members die and can't be raised at the time. 

%^CYAN%^%^ULINE%^Dying in player kill%^RESET%^
