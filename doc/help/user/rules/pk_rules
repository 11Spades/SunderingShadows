%^CYAN%^PK RULES%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^PK (player killing) encompasses any player vs player (PvP) scenario, not only those that lead to a death. These rules have been put in place to make the game fairer and more enjoyable for those that participate in player vs player events.  Read them carefully before engaging in PK. Refer to %^ORANGE%^<post PK rules>%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ for how to proceed after a PK.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^By playing this game you confirm that you have read and understood the below rules and agree to act in compliance with them.%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^PRIOR TO PK:%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^Rule 1: Engaging in PK is optional

New characters have a %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^ that protects them from aggressive characters. To opt into PK, turn the flag off (help set). When you turn this flag off, you signal to the player base that you are ready to engage in hostile roleplay. See %^ORANGE%^<NOPK>%^RESET%^ for rules on how to roleplay with a NOPK flag.

    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ The %^RED%^Grace flag%^RESET%^ from recent login functions as a NOPK flag for its duration.

PK races (%^ORANGE%^<races>%^RESET%^) have their flag turned off by default and should be chosen with care. Non-PK races who are not in an active conflict and wish to have their %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NOPK flag%^RESET%^ restored, can contact a member of staff (%^ORANGE%^<avatarmail>%^RESET%^).
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 2: Antagonistic actions.%^RESET%^

Antagonistic actions are defined as any action that purposefully provokes or annoys another character. Examples include but are not limited to: Verbal insults or threats, snitching, breaking city laws, emoting offensive actions, invasion of privacy, stealing from other players, scrying, being in a shapeshifted form, bringing an animal into a civilized area, and using dangerous, harmful and/or disruptive spells/abilities.
 
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 3: Keep it IC%^RESET%^

Do your best to keep PK in character (IC) and off the channels and try to resolve any IC conflict in an IC manner.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Ensure that your character has an IC reason for engaging in the PK. If possible, roleplay hostility and conflict before resorting to violence.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Race alone is only considered a valid reason if the intended opponent belongs to a PK-race or is in a dangerous shapeshifted form.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Do not act on information gained via OOC channels.

 
%^CYAN%^DURING A PK:%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^Rule 4: Show OOC consideration%^RESET%^

Everyone is here to have fun. Ensure that you have an IC reason to engage in PK and make it memorable for everyone involved. Show OOC consideration towards your fellow players:
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Do not leave your opponent bound and unconscious for longer than necessary.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Do not take gear that you do not need.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Do not offer the gear/money of your opponent.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Do not engage with a NOPK character during a PK.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ High level characters should not take antagonistic actions towards low level characters without provocation and are expected to show an additional level of OOC consideration towards easy targets.
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 5: Stay online and active.%^RESET%^

Do not quit, go inactive, or idle out without permission from the participating players. You are expected to stay online for 30 minutes after the last attack happened. In case of emergencies, state your emergency on the OOC line.
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 6: Torture is allowed, but:%^RESET%^
Sundering Shadows allows torture, dismemberment, and other forms of punishment/abuse provided everyone involved complies with the following:

Nobody should be forced or coerced into playing something they are uncomfortable with. Therefore, any player may, at any time:

    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Call for a Fade to Black %^ORANGE%^<help fade to black>%^RESET%^.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Call for less descriptive emotes.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Ask to be killed rather than to roleplay the consequences of torture, loss of limbs, etc, or simply to end the scene.	
	
Any scene sexual in nature MUST have the OOC consent of all players involved.

    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Consent must be obtained before the scene starts.
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Consent may be withdrawn at any time. It must be complied with.

If someone fails to respect a fade to black or withdrawal of consent we ask that you log or screenshot the exchange and contact staff immediately. If no staff is available, log off and use the %^ORANGE%^<lawmail>%^RESET%^ command to let us know. 
 
%^CYAN%^AFTER A PK:%^RESET%^

%^MAGENTA%^Rule 7: No repeat killings or harassment%^RESET%^

Repeatedly assaulting or killing the same character is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.  Likewise, killing a person because they killed you (aka revenge killing), either personally or by proxy, is not allowed.

Note that characters who repeatedly engage in robberies and/or murder, or target lower-level characters, will find the world reacting accordingly: IC actions have IC consequences.
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 8: Always PK-mail%^RESET%^

When you engage in, or witness, a player killing incident, you are required to use the %^ORANGE%^<pkmail>%^RESET%^ command to inform the staff of the following:
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Who engaged? When, where and why did it happen?
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ Were there any witnesses, casualties and/or property damage?
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ What was the result of your encounter?
    %^MAGENTA%^<>%^RESET%^ What, if any, precautions did you take to conceal or cover up the PK?

This applied regardless of the outcome. We also ask that you send us a pkmail when you hire an assassin and put a bounty on someone.
 
%^MAGENTA%^%^MAGENTA%^Rule 9: Alts in PK%^RESET%^

If you play multiple characters and one of your alts is involved in a PK, we ask that you exclusively play only that character for the next 7 days, until the situation is resolved, or until you are PKâ€™d. This is to give other players and the world itself time to respond. See <help alts> for more information. If you are killed in the PK, you may not use another alt to initiate PK involving the same characters for 7 days or until the situation has been resolved.
 
%^MAGENTA%^Rule 10: Take a deep breath.%^RESET%^

If your character is killed, they will be locked in a special death area where you can calm down and write your %^ORANGE%^<pkmail>%^RESET%^. If you hated the experience, consider opting out of PK by asking the staff for a NOPK flag.

Everyone involved in the PK should now take a moment to calm down, write their avatarmail and refer to help %^ORANGE%^<post pk rules>%^RESET%^ for how to proceed. Feel free to contact staff for guidance.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Failure to comply with the rules will result in punishment and repeat offenders may be banned and/or rid. If these rules are unclear, contact our staff for clarification.%^RESET%^
