The following commands exist for you to talk to multiple people

newbie          hm
fighter         cleric
thief           mage
assassin        ranger
paladin         cavalier
antipaladin     bard

If you have followed any deity, you will have the line of that deity
as well. The command is the name of your deity. If you have joined any
guild. You will have an extra guild channel for you to use. The command
is the name of your guild. You may also send emotes over the chat lines
by appending "emote" onto the command name.

Example:

newbieemote smiles at everyone

Would show to people:

<newbie> Descartes smiles at everyone.


These channels are more often called "lines", so you may want to read up the
file under "help line use".
