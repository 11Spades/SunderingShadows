Neutral Good:
     Unlike those directly opposite (neutral evil) in alignment, beings
of neutral good believe that there must be some regulation in 
combination with freedoms if the best is to be brought to the world - the
most beneficial conditions for living things in general and intelligent
beings in particular.
