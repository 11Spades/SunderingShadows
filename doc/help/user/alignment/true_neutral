%^RESET%^A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea.  She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos.  Most neutrality is a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality.  Such a character thinks of good as better than evil.  After all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones.  Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  A wizard who devotes herself to her art and is bored by the semantics of moral debate is neutral.  Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality.  They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes.  They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.  True neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
