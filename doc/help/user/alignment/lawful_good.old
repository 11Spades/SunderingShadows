Lawful Good:
     While as strict in their prosecution of law and order, characters 
of the lawful good alignment follow these precepts to improve the 
common wealth. Certain freedoms must, of course, be sacrificed in order
to bring order; but truth is of highest value, and life and beauty
of great importance. The benefits of this society are brought to all.
