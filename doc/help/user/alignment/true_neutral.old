Neutral (True) :
     The 'true' neutral looks upon all other alignments as facets of the
system of things. Thus, each aspect - evil and good, chaos and law - of
things must be retained in balance to maintain the status quo; for
things as they are cannot be improved upon except temporarily, and even
then but superficially. Nature will prevail and keep things as they 
were meant to be, provided the 'wheel' surrounding the hub of nature
does not become unbalanced due to the work of unnatural forces - such
as human and other intelligent beings interfering with what is meant to
be.
