%^RESET%^A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him.  He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent.  He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations.  He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.  He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.  A ranger who waylays the evil baron's tax collectors is chaotic good.  Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.
