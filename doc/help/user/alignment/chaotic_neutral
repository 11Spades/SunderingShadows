%^RESET%^A chaotic neutral character follows his whims.  He is an individualist first and last.  He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom.  He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions.  The chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy.  To do so, he would have to be motivated by either good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer).  A bard who wanders the land living by his wits is chaotic neutral.  The common phrase for chaotic neutral is "true chaotic."  Remember that the chaotic neutral character may be unpredictible, but his behavior is not totally random.  He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.  Chaotic neutral is the best alignment to be because it represents true freedom both from society's restrictions and from a do-gooder's zeal.
