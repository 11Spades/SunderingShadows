%^RESET%^A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her.  Order and organization are paramount to her.  She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.  A monk who follows her discipline without being swayed by the demands of those in need nor by the temptations of evil is lawful neutral.  The common phrase for lawful neutral is "true lawful."  Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
