%^ULINE%^%^CYAN%^Alignments%^RESET%^

Your alignment shapes how you act on the world of ShadowGate. How you act, not what you do. Having a "cause" does not define your alignment, your alignment will simply direct how you further that cause.

Each humanoid race allows certain standard alignments. There is a chance during character creation that you may be allowed to pick a non-standard alignment, but you will be restricted in your choices for alignment by what race you choose. Each alignment imposes restrictions on how you character may or may not act. For example, good characters will never use some spells. Rationalization of the reasons is left to your character's discretion: evil characters may freely argue they are not doing harm and may be objectively right about their version of truth. Ultimate truth or its absence is defined only by your mutual interaction and roleplay.

However, ShadowGate provides several interpretations of alignments you are free to not follow. You may minimize unexpected tensions by following these guidelines or cause new conflicts by imagining your own, unique, path. In the end, alignment is just a thing on your character's score sheet and nobody but you can tell what it means.

To view possible interpretation of alignments refer to individual help files.
