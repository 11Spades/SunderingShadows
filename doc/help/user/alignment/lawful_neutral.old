Lawful Neutral:
     Those of this alignment view regulation as all-important, taking
a middle road between good and evil. This is because the ultimate
harmony of the world - and the whole of the universe - is considered
by lawful neutral beings to have its sole hope rest upon law and order.
Evil or good are immaterial when compared to the determined purpose
of bringing all to predictability and regulation.
