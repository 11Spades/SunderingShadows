%^CYAN%^Differences%^RESET%^

Welcome to Sundering Shadows. If you are visiting us from our sister MUD Shadowgate, you might be wondering what is different here. Below is a list of things that have changed, or that will change in the near future.

First of all, make sure to read <help rules>, <help pk rules> and <help post pk rules>. Any changes to these files will be announced. Note that pkmails will be mandatory.

Secondly, note that there will be no levelcheck on Sundering Shadows. This means you can interact with people of any level, provided you follow the rules explained in the files above.

Thirdly, be sure to read help races. All beast races are now PK-races and require a level 30 account. Some races have been removed from character creation, others have been temporarily disabled pending changes. If you already have a character of that race, you can continue to play it. Beast races will be banned from most non-monster cities, with the exception of drow and half-drow who are allowed in Tonovi. Undead are of course allowed in Nurval. Were-creatures and other races that can pass for a non-PK race should be allowed in cities until exposed.

Other differences of note:

Clerics now gain access to 5 spells per domain that are added to their spell list. They can still cast a prepared spell as a healing spell, but not as a domain spell.

Creators:

Any changes made to the game will currently go through Tlaloc. A system will be set up in the future to better handle the coding team, but for now, Tlaloc is the gatekeeper.

Law:

Law is currently Kismet, Tlaloc, Chernobog, Tsera and Yves. Law can be contacted on admin@sunderingshadows.com or via <lawmail>.
