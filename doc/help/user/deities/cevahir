%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^History: %^RESET%^Yet to be discovered

%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Regards to Undead: %^RESET%^The faithful of Cevahir do not have a unified view on undead. Some see the creatures as a tool to use much like any other, while others avoid undead due to their own personal beliefs.

%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Vestments: %^RESET%^Priests of Cevahir are often warpriests who dress in the armor of their homeland. They work the purple and white of Cevahir into their garb in some way, and many have amethyst set into their scabbards or weapons. During ceremonies and on feast days, priests wear trim white pants and shirts topped by a purple tabard bearing the holy symbol of Cevahir. The color of the piping along the tabard indicates rank, with newly initiated wearing brightest white and increasing rank darkening toward gold. The high priest of Cevahir is granted the honor of having piping made of thread of gold.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Faith-based groups:
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The Gambit: %^RESET%^Not a single group, this name is used by countless war councils in service to the Lady of the Battlefield. They form and dissolve as needed, often gathered to advise rulers who seek to expand their domain - or defend their realm. As such, they are often pitted against each other, which the faithful take as a delightful challenge.
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The Warlord's Blade: %^RESET%^This mercenary group is made up of members of all trades who offer their services to the highest bidder. Known as a nearly unstoppable force in the land, the Warlord's Blade is sought-after by the wealthiest nations, but they refuse to commit to a single nation or cause permanently.
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The Stratagems: %^RESET%^A convocation of intellectuals, the Stratagems dedicate their lives to perfecting strategy. They study battles and militaries, reading first-hand accounts from soldiers and generals alike. They travel far and wide collecting and searching for lore, all to the greater glory of the Stratagem's Perfection.
