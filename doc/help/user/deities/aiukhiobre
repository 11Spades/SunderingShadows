%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:%^RESET%^
%^ORANGE%^Jokingly, it is said, the very earth you walk is the flesh Aiukhiobre. This immemorial being meddles little with affairs of the living, shaping the earth from floors The Deep up to the highest mountains of The Dry to her liking and subtle balances of her slowly changing mood. Keeping to the deep bowels of the earth and claiming all its powers, she forms a presence one with all stones, metals and matter that is foundation to everything existing. Like other Leviathans, she no longer notices lesser beings less they interfere in her domain. Her presence is often felt through earthquakes and takes eons to settle. Only those of calm and orderly existence respond to her affinities and powers she governs.%^WHITE%^
