%^BOLD%^%^RED%^History: %^RESET%^%^RED%^Unlike the rest of the pantheon, while countless stories abound concerning the race, gender and origins of the Faceless One, they become impossible to verify beyond mere hearsay. Some, most likely ex-faithful of the Dark Sun, claim that he is the god of madness, raised to even greater strength than his prior incarnation through the murder of his enemies. Others voice a tale of a bitter crone, whose whispers stirred the greatest of the god's of madness servants to spill his blood upon the unhallowed grounds of his temple. Yet more, that she was a stunning harlot of half-elven blood, who seduced Mask himself only to steal from him the very relics of his divinity. Most drowkind believe him to be an assassin of their own lineage, sly enough to twist the surfacers activities to his own ends. Whatever the case, the true nature of the Faceless One remains shrouded in potential deceptions and lies even to this day...

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead: %^RESET%^%^RED%^Undead are regularly called upon by the faithful, seen as one of numerous means to their desired ends.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The Whispers: %^RESET%^%^RED%^An alliance of particularly wealthy nobility, who actively attempt to turn the workings of various political systems to their own benefit, and that of the faithful. Rarely are they revealed, and certainly such public acknowledgement usually results in a shortened lifespan.
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Cabal of the Dark Prince: %^RESET%^%^RED%^A sect dedicated to the charge of the immortal known as Durias, only small in number but known to be utterly merciless. Their dark rituals are whispered of with fear within civilized circles.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^*NOTE:%^BLACK%^ Being an ally or enemy does not necessarily mean you must aid or kill on sight. Determine the best course of action for your character based on your character's beliefs, the other individual(s) in question, and past actions/interactions with the individual(s) and/or their faith.
