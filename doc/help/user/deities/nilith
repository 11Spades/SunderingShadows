%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^History: %^BLACK%^As a mortal, Nilith was a powerful tiefling general of Graez long departed from the word of history. Her army once marauded through the island, pillaging and plundering all of the wealth it could find. After many years of this, when the citizens thought it would never end, they vanished without a trace, leaving only destruction and death behind. Nilith reappeared in 742 SG as a whisper, her shining black platemail replaced by long dark robes, and her pitch-black skin adorned with gold paint. Her undead armies ravaged the land, a distraction as she murdered Varda and assumed the mantle of the god of war.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Vestments: %^BLACK%^The clergy differ wildly in their dress from stunning opulence to simple black garments embroidered with bones as a testament to their faith. Followers generally adorn themselves in extravagent silks, gold, silver, and the finer things that they have earned (or stolen) for themselves. However, some followers choose to wear simple, plain garments. As many people see undead as abominations, some followers choose to hide their faith from the general populace.%^RESET%^
