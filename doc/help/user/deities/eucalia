%^GREEN%^BOLD%^History: %^WHITE%^Eucalia, it is rumored, lived her life as a dryad, deep in the Kilkean forest, seemingly living a completely solitary life, far from even the other dryads in the Moonstone Vale. In 751 SG, when the long night began the many forests of the world began to die off, withering in the lack of sunlight. Eucalia, seeing the desperation of the situation, began to gather seeds, to protect them from the cold, shadows, and darkness within her bosom. While the last of the plants died off, and the animals and peoples of the world starved, Eucalia curled up in her grove, curling herself around the seeds in a protective cocoon, whispering prayers as she perished, giving her life to protect the sanctity of the seeds inside her. When Edea was awakened, the prayers were heard, and Eucalia was returned to life, filled with divine energy. As the light returned to the world, she planted her seed and blessed them, causing them to grow with enhanced vigor and speed. It is said, among her followers, that all living plants that exist within the world are descended from those seeds.

%^GREEN%^BOLD%^Regards to Undead: %^WHITE%^The undead are abhorred completely by Eucalia.

%^GREEN%^BOLD%^Regards to Outsiders: Eucalia abhors most outsiders, especially demons and devils (including demon/devil blooded), and shadow creatures. She tolerates deva, einherjar and other celestials, but does not revere them.

%^GREEN%^BOLD%^Dogma: %^WHITE%^Nourish and encourage growth and life wherever you go. Endenger good will between the forests and the sapient creatures of the world and encourage harmony. Protect the forests from those who would exploit them or endanger the sanctity of life within. Encourage peaceful visitors to the forest so that they might see the beauty and glory of all things natural.

%^GREEN%^BOLD%^Note :%^RESET%^ Eucalia is a demigod/lesser deity that has not formally established herself amongst the pantheon. There may or may not be temples or even widespread knowledge of her existence.
