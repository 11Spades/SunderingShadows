Despite his chaotic demeanor, Yor Zish might be the only one of immemorial presences that still notices existence of mortals, and known to have communicated with them in the past millennia. Strongest of all immemorial beings, she exercises her power for own amusement. She is known for toying with creation, unmaking and revenge and claims skies, winds and cold as powers she her domains. All sailors, especially pirates, entities of the winds and cold, creatures of the sky - all are under influence of her affinities.
