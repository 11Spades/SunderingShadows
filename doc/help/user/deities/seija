%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History: %^BLUE%^Born from the remnants of the being known as Ryorik, Seija represents the elements in balance. While Ryorik's long history was shrouded in mystery, Seija emerged like a breath of spring air from the chaos of Ryorik's demise. The destructive pieces of the old deity's essence splintered and reformed in Khyron, with the rest coalescing into this monk-like being dedicated to the balance of the elements.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead: %^BLUE%^The faith abhors undead. Any follower caught using such would be bashed, hunted and mocked for abusing nature and abandoning their trust in elemental magic and power.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments: %^BLUE%^There are no stipulations for garments within Seija's temple, though most faithful wear teardrop-shaped jewelry in honor of Seija. The priests often clothe themselves in clothes that represent their favored element, such as blue for air or cold and yellow for fire or earth. Rangers often favor long bows if they are not using scimitars to show honor towards Seija.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Primordial Covenant: %^BLUE%^Once a small sect working in secret, they are now the most powerful force among Seija's clergy. Like Seija herself, members of this group believe that the elemental powers work together and not against each other. These individuals stepped forward to tend her temple and spread their message. When Khyron broke free from Seija, many viewed it almost as an exorcism and feel that now their deity can tend to the elements and keep them in balance as they should be.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Cleansing Flame: %^BLUE%^A rather large sect, formed by a Prince whom believes that fire is the most powerful and important of the natural elements. The belief of this sect is to "cleanse" or "purify" people through flame. Many subsects of this sect run about determining exactly how and what it means to purify someone, the common thread for all of them is their disdain for Winter's Teeth.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Flock: %^BLUE%^This sect covers the majority of Seija's temple and includes those who wish to live their lives however they see fit. It can range from clergy men who heal to smiths or fickle bards; in such, it is more individuals than an unified group.
