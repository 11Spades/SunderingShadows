%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History: %^BLUE%^Yet to be recorded, as loremaster assigned to this job drinks in the pub with some fairy queen.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead: %^BLUE%^The faith abhors undead. Any follower caught using such would be bashed, hunted and mocked for abusing nature and abandoning their trust in elemental magic and power.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments: %^BLUE%^There are no stipulations for garments within Seija's temple, though most faithful wear teardrop-shaped jewelry in honor of Seija. The priests often clothe themselves in clothes that represent their favored element, such as blue for air or cold and yellow for fire or earth. Rangers often favor long bows if they are not using scimitars to show honor towards Seija.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Primordial Covenant: %^BLUE%^Once a small sect working in secret, they are now the most powerful force among Seija's clergy. Like Seija herself, members of this group believe that the elemental powers work together and not against each other. These individuals stepped forward to tend her temple and spread their message. When Khyron broke free from Seija, many viewed it almost as an exorcism and feel that now their deity can tend to the elements and keep them in balance as they should be.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Flock: %^BLUE%^This sect covers the majority of Seija's temple and includes those who wish to live their lives however they see fit. It can range from clergy men who heal to smiths or fickle bards; in such, it is more individuals than an unified group.
