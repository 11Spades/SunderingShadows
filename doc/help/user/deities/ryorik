%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History: %^BLUE%^Ryorik's history is long and most of it is buried deep in the earth, but there are some that talk of a time when primordial deity used him to merge elemental power into a single being. Talos was hoping to weaken the primordials of his time, yet it backfire on him with the aid of Sune and adventurers from the Shadow Region. This lead to Ryorik being redeemed to a point he was willing to accept the burden his past had placed on him and ascend to divinity.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead: %^BLUE%^The faith abhors undead. Any follower caught using such, would be bashed, hunted and mocked for abusing nature and abandoning their trust in elemental magic and power!

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments: %^BLUE%^There are no stipulations for garments within Ryorik's temple, though most faithful will carry some type of scimitar in honor of Ryorik. The priest often cloth themselves in clothes that represent their favored element, such as blue for air or cold and yellow for fire or earth. Rangers often favor long bows if they are not using scimitars to show honor towards Sidara.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Faith-based groups:
None.  Most of Ryorik's clergy, feeling the loss of power from their god, are fleeing to others.
