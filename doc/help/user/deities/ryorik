%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History: %^BLUE%^Ryorik's history is long and most of it is buried deep in the earth, but there are some that talk of a time when primordial deity used him to merge elemental power into a single being. Talos was hoping to weaken the primordials of his time, yet it backfire on him with the aid of Sune and adventurers from the Shadow Region. This lead to Ryorik being redeemed to a point he was willing to accept the burden his past had placed on him and ascend to divinity.  

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead: %^BLUE%^The faith abhors undead. Any follower caught using such, would be bashed, hunted and mocked for abusing nature and abandoning their trust in elemental magic and power!

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments: %^BLUE%^There are no stipulations for garments within Ryorik's temple, though most faithful will carry some type of scimitar in honor of Ryorik. The priest often cloth themselves in clothes that represent their favored element, such as blue for air or cold and yellow for fire or earth. Rangers often favor long bows if they are not using scimitars to show honor towards Sidara. 

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Cleansing Flame: %^BLUE%^A rather large sect, formed by a Prince whom believes that fire is the most powerful and important of the natural elements. The belief of this sect is to "cleanse" or "purify" people through flame. Many subsects of this sect run about determining exactly how and what it means to purify someone, the common thread for all of them is their disdain for Winter's Teeth.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Sidara's Flock: %^BLUE%^This sect covers the majority of Ryorik's temple and is appropriate named after his mortal wife. It includes those who wish to live their lives however they see fit. It can range from clergy men whom heal to smiths or your fickle bards, in such it is more individuals than an unified group. 
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Primordial Covenant: %^BLUE%^A sect that believes elemental powers work together and not against each other. They have been around for thousands of years, but until recently were forced to remain hidden or silent as the outstanding belief was that the elements raged against one another. With the merger of Ryorik they are stepping forward to tend his temple and spread their message.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^*NOTE:%^WHITE%^ Being an ally or enemy does not necessarily mean you must aid or kill on sight. Determine the best course of action for your character based on your character's beliefs, the other individual(s) in question, and past actions/interactions with the individual(s) and/or their faith.
