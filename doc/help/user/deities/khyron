%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^History: %^RED%^Yet to be discovered.

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Regards to Undead: %^RED%^Undead are neither revered nor reviled among the faithful of Khyron, who use the tools they have to unleash destruction upon the land.

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Vestments: %^RED%^Servants of Khyron favor shades of black and gray that highlight the brilliant reds, yellows, and ice blues they use to accentuate their clothing. Their priestly vestments are shredded, the ends singed in their riotous ceremonies that occur around bonfires held on the darkest night, when the light of their true god shines brighter than even the moon. The vestments change throughout a priest's life, with a new strip of colored fabric added for each storm or instance of destruction the priest causes - red for fire, yellow for lightning, white for ice, and cyan for wind.

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Devoted: %^RESET%^%^RED%^This core group operates in the open to topple Ryorik and take the power they believe belongs rightfully to Khyron. They will stop at nothing to reunite the power of the elements under the one true god, and members are often found spouting their beliefs on street corners throughout the Realms. Their often haggard appearance has earned them the nickname Fleas, but they wear even this name with pride, bellowing to anyone who will listen about how the lowly flea can bring about the destruction of the most noble lion.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Stormbringers: %^RESET%^%^RED%^Adventurers and navigators by trade, Stormbringers are often hired by captains who are crossing the wide sea. They use their gifts from Khyron to predict and direct storms, bringing their cargo and passengers to safety - for a price, which often includes listening to tales of the Ravager's glory and a percentage of the goods going directly into the church's coffers. Some coastal cities employ Stormbringers in much the same way, though they are not known for their discretion and sometimes find themselves ousted thanks to angry townsfolk.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Blade of the Tempest: %^RESET%^%^RED%^This collective led by rangers and bards are dedicating to spreading word of their lord. They roam the lands, ravaging and pillaging, burning large swathes of forests and fields. Only when the locals erect shrines to Khyron and pray for his protection do they move on to their next target.
