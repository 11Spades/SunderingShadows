%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^Usuiguth Zlo is the eldest of immemorial presences, and had been existed so long its mind warped and advanced beyond comprehension of others. Compared to others, he is relatively weak and mortal gods might have a chance of scratching his existence if acting together. The Leviathan formed powers responsible for ending, death and undeath, he is rumored to be the power that ended the world before and will end the world living. He gathers gods of undeath, diseases, undead beings under influence of his affinities. Millenia ago, he was the only presence in The Deep, long before other Leviathans existed he plagued minds of lesser beings with nightmares and visions of the end. Usuiguth Zlo is known to act slowly and to plot millenea ahead, thus actions of mortals often escape his omnipresent eyes.%^WHITE%^
