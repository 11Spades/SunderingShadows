%^MAGENTA%^Known to some as The Deep One, Usuiguth is the oldest of the great old ones. Usuiguth is represented often in artwork - particularly in sculpture, painting, and poetry, for her influence is particularly strong among such sensitive minds. In these eldritch works of art, she is depicted or described as having a vaguely feminine frame, but with immense bat-like wings and a skirt of tencacles. Her actual form is somewhat fluid, as being that predates existence she can shift and reshape her exact countenance as she wills, and have no form alltogether, allowing her to be everywhere and nowhere, as she wishes. Usuiguth currently slumbers away the eons in a state neither quite dead nor living, held in her endless dreams that slip into sensitive minds of gods and mortals, inspiring otherworldly, alien madness and powers.
