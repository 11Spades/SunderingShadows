Player housing is a good way for your character to leave a mark on the world. Players are encouraged to come up with good ideas and submit them, and keeping them limited in scope is the best way to get approved. Good ideas could be: A house in the woods, a garden of butterflies, or a small island with a few rooms.

RP will be prioritized for property locations. For instance, to build near the city of Shadow, the player will need to maintain proper relations with the city and be in good standing. Properties can be remodeled and added onto at a later date, do not feel the need to get a large sprawling property directly from the start. All properties need to have a physical entrance or means of entry in the sense of fairness - nowhere can be 100% isolated and inaccessible.

All prices are in gold coins.

Renovations of rooms and additional features will cost half of the item's original cost. New rooms and features added will be the full cost.

Regarding old player housing:

Player houses are considered abandoned and for purchase if the player (not the character) is inactive. A player is considered inactive if they have not played in the past three years and they are unable to be contacted. A player may relinquish this protection for their properties.

Property for a character who has been officially retired and converted to an NPC becomes locked and unavailable. If that retirement is reversed for whatever reason, the property loses any such protections in the future. 

An abandoned property is valued at half the total cost of construction. Purchasing the property does not convey any further activity besides a change in ownership.

Active characters that are both owned by the same player are not permitted to trade or sell properties to each other. Characters can purchase properties owned by their retired characters at the abandoned property cost.
