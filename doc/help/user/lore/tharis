%^CYAN%^NOTES:
Tharis has a changed hands several times in the last century, passing from a human duke to an invading mercenary company, to a drow house and finally to the Shadovar Empire. Existing in the shadow of the floating city of Tenebrosa, the residents of Tharis have grown accustomed to living in darkness and among the beings such darkness attracts. More recently the city was given over to Lord Balur Black to oversee in the name of the Shadovar Empire and he has wasted no time in reshaping it into a nexus of exotic nightmares.
