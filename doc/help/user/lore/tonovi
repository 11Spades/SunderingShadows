%^CYAN%^NOTES:
Tonovi recently underwent a popular revolution, led by Kaspar Strauss, which saw the overthrow and execution of all of the old nobility. Tonovi recently banned the slave trade and released the penned slaves, but has replaced those slaves with enemies of the state. Kaspar Strauss, and the Unity Party, rule with an iron fist as they return Tonovi to the great power it once was.
