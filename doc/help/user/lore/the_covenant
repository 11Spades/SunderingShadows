The Covenant refers to an ancient agreement on cosmological flow of the souls between long forgotten gods and the first mortals. It included condition of worship as a payment mortals provide for an after life promise gods give, the fact that there was divinity assigned to oversee the cycle of souls, and the inevitable fate of all unfaithful to end in the wall of souls.

Many eons have passed since, the exact wording of The Covenant is now forgotten by everyone but Kismet. The fate of mortals is no longer so clear, but the wall of soul still stands: in this age it belongs to Lysara, awaiting unfaithful. Faithful are known to transfer after death into realms of their gods. Those that deal with powerful outsiders or found other means of existence might find another destiny, such cases are more and more frequent since The Silence.
