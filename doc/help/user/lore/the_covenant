%^CYAN%^%^ULINE%^The Covenant%^RESET%^

The Covenant refers to an ancient agreement between long forgotten gods and first mortals on cosmological flow of the souls. It included condition of worship and after death promise, the fact that there was divinity assigned to oversee the cycle of souls, and the inevitable fate of all unfaithful to end in the wall of souls.

Many eons have passed since, the exact wording of The Covenant is now forgotten by all but Kismet. The fate of mortals is no longer so clear, but the wall of unfaithful still stands: this age it belongs to Lysara, awaiting unfaithful. Faithful are known to transfer after death into realms of their gods. Those that deal with powerful outsiders or found other means of existence might find another destiny, such cases are more and more frequent since The Silence.
