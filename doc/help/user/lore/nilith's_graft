%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Nilith's Graft:
%^ORANGE%^Nilith's Graft is the name colloquially given to several fell divine rituals that transform willing intelligent living being into a greater undead. Such creature won't rot, experience fatigue, hunger, thirst or age, but also will know little of carnal pleasures. They build new goals in existence, often alien to what the living strive for.

%^ORANGE%^Nilith places a price on such transformation unless her plotting is directly involved. To transform oneself one must commit to a sacrifice of own blood, own children or kith that are close or dear to them.

%^ORANGE%^The gift can be shared in a moment of inspiration to another being. The inspiration must meet certain conditions, often obscure and prophetic.
