%^CYAN%^NOTES:
Known as a breeding pit of the worst sorts of demi-human beasts, the ruined city known as Juran is a filthy hovel full of beast races and their slaves. Little is known of who or what claims direct control, though there are rumors that the city has fallen under the power of the Shadovar Empire, with many of their more civilized denizens migrating to the beshadowed city of Tharis.
