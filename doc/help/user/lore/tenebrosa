%^CYAN%^NOTES:
Tenebrosa is a city of dark wonders, shrouded in mystery. Home of the Shadovar who returned after over a millennium spent in the Shadowfell, it now hovers over Tharis, casting the lower city in its considerable shadow. The skies about the great city are afflicted with a miasma of gloom that seems to repel attempts at gaining entry from those uninvited. It is ruled by the children of Lord Shadow, the Princes of Shade, who rarely seem to leave their city, instead relying on powerful agents to enforce their will and spread the web of the Empire’s growing influence.
