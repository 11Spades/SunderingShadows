%^CYAN%^NOTES:
The great pyramid Nurval lies in the ruins of the former city of Daggerdale. The pyramid appeared one day within the ruins of the old city, emanating massive levels of negative energy, turning the dead there into walking monstrosities. Over the years, followers of Nilith have come, rebuilt parts of the city around the pyramid and have dedicated a great temple to Nilith. in 751 SG, several powerful undead (PCs) conjured a Nightwalker from the Plane of Shadows which summoned a huge horde of undead from cemetaries in the region. After it attacked Tonovi, it was destroyed by an intrepid band of heroes, who subsequently caused massive destruction to the area around the pyramid. The city was largely sealed off from the Dagger road by Arch Druid Rheyn, but a footpath was later opened by a myserious warlock named Sierra.
