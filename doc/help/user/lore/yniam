%^CYAN%^NOTES:
When the Unity Party took control of Tonovi, one of their first actions was a land grab eastward into the Yniam Plains up to, and including, the Dagger Road. Kaspar Strauss, Chancellor of Tonovi, turned it into a protectorate and placed it in the hands of Vikaelis. Yniam has managed to earn recognition as its own state through diplomacy with its various neighbors.
