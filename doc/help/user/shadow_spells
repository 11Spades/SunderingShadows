%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SHADOW SPELLS%^RESET%^

There are a number of spells in the game that create an illusion of a spell effect. These spells are known as shadow spells, mainly because they cause an illusory version of the spell effect in the attempts of convincing themselves or those around them that the effect is real.

%^BOLD%^Some examples of shadow spells are %^RED%^shadow evocation, shadow alteration, shades, and greater shadow conjuration.%^RESET%^

Shadow spells can cast mage spells of the specific school up to 1 spell level lower than the the spell level of the shadow spell.

Shadow spells cast the chosen spell at the same caster level as the shadow spell for purposes of damage, bonus, and duration calculations.

Spells cast by shadow spells always are considered to be of the illusion spell sphere and all have their save type set to WILL.


%^CYAN%^BOLD%^Shadow spells get a decreased spell save DC as follows:
%^YELLOW%^DC = Original DC - (20 - (maximum shadow spell level * 2)) %^RESET%^

In our save system, 1 point of save/DC value represents a 5% increase/decrease on the outcome of the d20 roll.

A spell cast by shadow evocation (maximum shadow spell level of 4) would have a penalty of 12 to the DC representing an increase of 60% on the outcome of the roll by the target, or a 40% effectiveness compared to a non-illusory version of the spell.

A spell cast by shades (maximum shadow spell level of 8) would have a penalty of 4 to the DC representing an increase of 20% on the outcome of the roll by the target, or a 80% effectiveness compared to a non-illusory version of the spell.



Spells like Bend Reality, Reality Revision, Limited Wish, and Wish are NOT shadow spells and do not suffer DC penalties.
