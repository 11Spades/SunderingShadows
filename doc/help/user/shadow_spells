%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SHADOW SPELLS%^RESET%^

There are a number of spells in the game which create an illusion of a spell effect. These spells are known as shadow spells, mainly because they cause an illusory version of the spell effect in the attempts of convincing themselves or those around them that the effect is real.

%^BOLD%^Some examples of shadow spells are %^RED%^shadow evocation, shadow alteration, shades, and greater shadow conjuration.%^RESET%^

Shadow spells cast the chosen spell at spell level - 1, no matter what the actual target spell level is.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^Shadow spells get a decreased spell save DC as follows:
%^YELLOW%^DC = (Original DC * spell level) / 10%^RESET%^

So a spell cast by shadow evocation would have 4/10th of the original DC, or 40 percent.

Spells like Bend Reality, Reality Revision, Limited Wish, and Wish are NOT shadow spells and do not suffer DC penalties, though they still cast at spell level - 1.
