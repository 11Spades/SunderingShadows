%^CYAN%^DIMINISHING RETURNS%^RESET%^

Some spell help files will denote that they %^RED%^BOLD%^have diminishing returns%^RESET%^. When these spells are cast on a target, and the target makes a save, the caster gets a -5 to spell DC for subsequent casts (of the same spell) on that same target for 5 rounds (about 30 seconds). Each subsequent cast resulting in the target making a save will reset the timer.

The diminishing returns are unique to the target and caster.

Diminishing returns are only present on spells that denote that they have diminishing returns. This is meant to keep spam casting of certain spells to a minimum.
