%^CYAN%^WISDOM (WIS)
%^RESET%^Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.

Wisdom can be broken down into:

%^CYAN%^Intuition - A character with a high intuition likely would be very perceptive and good at making educated guesses, and would be difficult to fool or lie to effectively.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Willpower - This gauges a character's strength of will, ability to resist magical forces, and sense of commitment to a cause. A character with a high Willpower would be difficult to harm with mind-affecting magic spells, could be quite stubborn, and would resist interrogation.

%^RESET%^
You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

%^CYAN%^* Your will save.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^* The Perception, Healing, and Survival skills.

%^RESET%^Wisdom is very important to priests and druids. They get bonus spells per level with higher wisdom scores. The higher spell levels require a minimum wisdom to be able to even cast those spells.  Wisdom is less important to rangers, who only need a score of 14 in order to be able to cast all of their spells.
