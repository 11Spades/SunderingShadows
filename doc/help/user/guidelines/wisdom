%^CYAN%^WISDOM (WIS)
%^RESET%^Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common 
sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence 
represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom 
represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. 
Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, 
and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you 
want your character to have acute senses, put a high score 
in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.

Wisdom can be broken down into:

%^CYAN%^Intuition - A character with a high intuition likely would be 
	%^CYAN%^very perceptive and good at making educated guesses, 
	%^CYAN%^and would be difficult to fool or lie to effectively.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Willpower - This gauges a character's strength of will, 
	%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^ability to resist magical forces, and sense of 
	%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^commitment to a cause. A character with a high 
	%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Willpower would be difficult to harm with mind-affecting
	%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^magic spells, could be quite stubborn, 
	%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^and would resist interrogation.

You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

%^CYAN%^* Saving throws vs mental attacks
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^* Some NWPS require a minimum WIS score

%^RESET%^Wisdom is very important to priests. They get bonus spells 
per level with higher wisdom scores. The higher spell levels 
require a minimum wisdom to be able to even cast those spells.

Stat Scores

1-3 %^CYAN%^Foolish %^RESET%^- You were the reason why the term a Fool and his 
	money are soon parted was invented. It's almost laughable how 
    	easy it is to tempt you to do something. The idea of even 
    	torture often makes you black out, and you easily give up 
    	any information, in detail, to those interrogating you.
4-6 %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Naive%^RESET%^ - You are easily swindled, and very naive about the 
    	world. Someone could tell you the sky is bright green and 
    	the clouds are actually fat elves floating in the sky, and 
    	you would believe them. You have no mental tolerance for 
    	torture or interrogation.
7-9 %^CYAN%^Below Average %^RESET%^- You tend to lack any "common sense", meaning 
    	you do silly or dangerous things often, that tend to backfire 
    	on you. It's rather easy for someone to lie to you, though not
    	to the extent of a naive person.
10-12 %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Average%^RESET%^ - The "standard" wisdom of an adult male and female
13-14 %^CYAN%^Above Average%^RESET%^ - You posses a fair amount of common sense. It's 
	more difficult for people to lie or swindle you, but still 
	possible if they have a believable tale. You have some 
	slight resistance to torture, though you could never hold out. 
	Interrogations might take a few minutes or even an hour to get 
	you to crack.
15-16 %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Clever%^RESET%^ - Your common sense and intuition often helps you out 
	when you need it most. It's more difficult for people to lie to 
	you, and you are often not swindled when dealing with a merchant. 
	You have a slight resistance to torture, able to mentally endure 
	the pain for awhile before screaming out. Interrogations take a 
	few hours to get you to crack.
17 - %^CYAN%^Wise%^RESET%^- Others often come to you for advice on every day life, for 
	your wisdom shines forth. Your common sense and intuition are 
	strong and solid, making it extremely difficult for others to lie 
	to you. Merchants often run the other way when they see you coming 
	to market, for they find you almost impossible to swindle. You are 
	able to mentally hold out in torture for a great length of time. 
	When interrogated, your willpower makes it extremely difficult for 
	them to make you talk.
18 - %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Sage %^RESET%^- You have an "iron will", meaning it is damn hard to get past 
	you. Your common sense and intuition are extremely strong and solid, 
	aiding you in everday life. It's nearly impossible for others to lie or 
	swindle you. When tortured, your iron allows you to mentally resist 
	much of the pain, keeping you from crying out. When interrogated, 
	your iron will makes it supremely difficult for others to make you 
	talk. Others might consider you "stubborn".
19 + %^CYAN%^Legendary Wisdom %^RESET%^- Your wisdom and willpower is as solid as adamantium
	or diamond. Your will is nearly impossible to break, and you can spot 
	lies a mile away often.  Your Wisdom is the stuff of legends and myths
