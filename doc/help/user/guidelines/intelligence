%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^INTELLIGENCE (INT)
%^RESET%^Intelligence determines how well your character 
learns and reasons. This ability is important for 
wizards because it affects how many spells they can 
cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how 
powerful their spells can be. It's also important 
for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.

Intelligence can be divided into:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Knowledge - This is a measurement of the character's 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^educational experiences-whether in a school or 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^on the streets, his grasp of languages, and his 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^memory capacity. A character with a high Knowledge 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^can speak many languages, knows something about 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^several subjects, and can remember the slightest 
	%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^detail of a past event.

%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^Reason - This defines how well a character handles new information.
	%^BLUE%^A character with a high Reason would be good at solving 
	%^BLUE%^riddles and puzzles, and would be talented at using 
	%^BLUE%^deductive, logical thinking.

%^RESET%^You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^* The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.
%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^* Some NPWs(non-weapon proficiencies) require a minimum in INT to learn.
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^* INT is very important for wizards, as the more powerful 
  %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^spells require a minimum to even learn and use.
%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^* Psions and Mages get bonus spells based on their Intelligence stat.

%^RESET%^An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. 
A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.

Stat Scores

1-3 %^BLUE%^Moronic%^RESET%^ - Your vocabulary is often limited to a few words and
	lots of grunts. Things such as sentences are just beyond you.
4-6 %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Dim%^RESET%^ - You tend to speak in very simple words, like that of a 4 
    	to 6 year old child. Puzzles and riddles often leave you confused. 
    	New information thrown at you sometimes leaves you feeling 
    	disoriented or confused.
7-9 %^BLUE%^Below Average %^RESET%^- You can manage to fumble your way in a conversation,
    	though you stick to simple words. Puzzles and riddles throw you off, 
    	often taking a few days to figure out some of the moderate ones, and 
    	the harder ones often months or years. You come across as being 
    	"unschooled", never really having any formal training.
10-12 %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Average%^RESET%^ - The "standard" intelligence of an adult male and female
13-14 %^BLUE%^Above Average%^RESET%^ - You are able to pick up on things easier than 
     	the normal individual. Learning a new language or bits of history 
     	tends to be somewhat easier for you. Your vocabulary might have a 
     	few fancier words thrown in like, opulent or plethora.
15-16 %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Smart%^RESET%^ - Others call you smart. Learning a new language or bits 
     	of history and lore is rather easy for you. You're able to carry 
     	on a conversation with more scholarly folk with some ease. There 
     	are a few subject matters where you are able to recite events 
     	from without any hesitation. (example Ancient History of Tsvaren,
     	Religon, A History of Art, or even Magical Theory)
17 - %^BLUE%^Brilliant%^RESET%^ - Your brilliance leaves others often astounded or jealous. 
     	You are able to pick up on new languages with ease and could be 
     	considered a master in many fields of knowledge (such as those 
     	mentioned above or plant lore, demon lore, undead lore, a 
     	history of warfare)
18 - %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Genius%^RESET%^ - You are a true genius. You can solve complex riddles and 
     	puzzles in your free time for fun. You have a wide range of 
     	subjects that you can recite detailed information about. Some 
     	might consider you a sage in a few fields, and seek you out for 
     	your brilliance.
19+ - %^BLUE%^Legendary Intelligence%^RESET%^- Your intelligence is the stuff legends 
	are made of. People are left in awe at (or perhaps even a bit spooked) 
	just how smart you are.
