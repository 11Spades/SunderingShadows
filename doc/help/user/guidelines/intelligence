%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^INTELLIGENCE (INT)
%^RESET%^Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards, psions, and psywarriors because it affects how many spells/powers they can cast, how hard their spells/powers are to resist, and how powerful their spells/powers can be.

Intelligence can be divided into:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Knowledge - This is a measurement of the character's educational experiences-whether in a school or  on the streets, his grasp of languages, and his memory capacity. A character with a high Knowledge can speak many languages, knows something about  several subjects, and can remember the slightest detail of a past event.

%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^Reason - This defines how well a character handles new information. A character with a high Reason would be good at solving riddles and puzzles, and would be talented at using deductive, logical thinking.

%^RESET%^You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^* The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.
%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^* You add your intelligence bonus to Academics, Healing, and Spellcraft skills.
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^* INT is very important for wizards, psions, and psywarriors, as the more powerful spells/powers require a minimum to even learn and use.
%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^* Mages get bonus spells based on their Intelligence stat.
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^* Psions and psywarriors gain extra power points based on their Intelligence stat.

%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^* The Academics and Spellcraft skills.

%^RESET%^An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. 
A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.

8-9: %^BLUE%^Below Average %^RESET%^- You can manage to fumble your way in a conversation, though you stick to simple words. Puzzles and riddles throw you off, often taking a few days to figure out some of the moderate ones, and the harder ones often months or years.
