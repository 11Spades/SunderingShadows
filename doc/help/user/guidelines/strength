%^BOLD%^%^RED%^STRENGTH (STR)
%^RESET%^Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for barbarians, fighters, paladins, psywarriors, rangers, and cavaliers, because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of equipment your character can carry.

To further explain what defines the Strength score, it can be broken down into:

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Muscle - Muscle measures the sheer power a character can exert at a moment's notice. A character with a higher muscle ratio than his Stamina will look quite strong. Males will have bulging biceps, broad chests, and wide shoulders. While females don't generate the muscle mass of males, they will have well-defined, strongly toned forms.

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Stamina - Stamina determines muscle efficiency. A character with a higher stamina than muscle may not have masses of huge muscles,but the muscles he has will be rock hard. Characters like these may surprise others; not because they can lift four hay bales at once, but because they can lift one or two at a time for 10 hours straight.

%^RESET%^You apply your character's Strength modifier to:

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^* Melee attack rolls.
%^RESET%^%^RED%^* Damage rolls when using a melee weapon
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^* Encumbrance - How much you character can carry
