%^MAGENTA%^CHARISMA (CHA)
%^RESET%^Charisma measures a character's force of personality, 
persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and 
physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual 
strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived 
by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important 
for paladins and bards. It is also important for clerics, 
in being able to lead their church/faith and in preaching.

Charisma can be divided into:

%^MAGENTA%^Leadership - A character with a high Leadership often 
	%^MAGENTA%^may be a group's leader, or at least its spokesman. Generals 
	%^MAGENTA%^and those who can calm or incite a mob with a few words all 
	%^MAGENTA%^have good Leadership scores.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Appearance - This determines the physical presence and 
	%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^attractiveness of the character. A character with a 
	%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^high Appearance score would be handsome or beautiful, 
	%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^perhaps even famous for outstanding looks (such as Helen of Troy).
