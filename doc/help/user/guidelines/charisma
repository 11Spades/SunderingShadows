%^MAGENTA%^CHARISMA (CHA)
%^RESET%^Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins and bards. It is also important for clerics, in being able to lead their church/faith and in preaching.

Charisma can be divided into:

%^MAGENTA%^Appearance - This determines the physical presence and attractiveness of the character. A character with a high Appearance score would be handsome or beautiful, perhaps even famous for outstanding looks (such as Helen of Troy). This can be completely ignored in the favor of Presence.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Presence - Your ability to influence others is defined by charisma. You may be physically unappealing, but your words move people, strike fear or awe in them. Generals, politicians, investigators, inquisitors are those people who have good Presence score.

%^RESET%^You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

%^MAGENTA%^* Aggressive Mobs, some mobs will ignore a character with a high charisma score.
%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^* The spellcasting abilities of sorcerers, bards, and warlocks is based off of Charisma.
