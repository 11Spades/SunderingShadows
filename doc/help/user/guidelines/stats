The Six Stats that help to define your character are
* Strength
* Dexterity
* Constitution
* Wisdom
* Intelligence
* Charisma

Each of these stats have a help file to better explain 
what they stand for, and table to gauge your strengths 
and weaknesses.  The information in these files is taken 
from D&D Player's Handbook.  The subtypes are taken from 
Player's Option: Skills and Power, as a way to better 
explain what makes up each stat.
