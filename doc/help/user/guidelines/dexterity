%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^DEXTERITY (DEX)
%^RESET%^Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, 
reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most 
important one for rogues, but it's also high on the 
list for characters who typically wear light or 
medium armor or no armor at all, and for anyone who 
wants to be a skilled archer.

To further explain what defines the Dexterity score, 
it can be broken down into:

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Aim - A character with a high Aim might be an expert 
	%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^marksman or a sleight-of-hand artist.

%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Balance - A character possessing a high Balance may 
	%^GREEN%^be an acrobat or a tightrope walker.

%^RESET%^You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^* Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made 
  %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.
%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^* Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react 
  %^GREEN%^to the attack.
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^* Some NWPS use Dexterity as a prime ability score
