After much discussion among the immortals, we have reached a few decisions to hopefully clarify pk situations and make things a little easier to deal with.  We realize PK can be a sticky situation and there are a lot of questions, but hopefully these guidelines will help.  This post deals mainly with time limits and the interactions between the killer and the victim.  How their friends react and things of that nature (including betrayal) will be covered in other posts.

%^RED%^Time Limits%^RESET%^
One of the problems we have encountered is:  How long do you need to wait before you can interact with the other person?  We've recently simplified this to hopefully make post-PK interaction easier to deal with.

Neither the killer nor the victim may use any means to contact the other person or find out information about them.  The victim is dead, the situation is over.  This means no scrying, no listening shadows, no tells, nothing.  This state lasts until the killer and victim happen to run into each other IN PERSON.  When they do encounter each other in person, they have the chance to interact with each other, provided that 4 days real-time have passed. Prior to this, the players MUST ignore each other if they do bump into one another, as if they were strangers - because the victim should, to all belief, be quite dead. This is to allow time for the victim to recover.

Following the 4 days realtime, however, the victim can be re-involved in any plots (including those they may have previously been involved in.  They can also be involved in PK again.  It is by this point that the killer, should they run into the victim, can realise that their victim is, in fact, quite alive, and any interactions (plot, PK or otherwise) can continue normally from here.  All previous plot interactions can be remembered and resumed by the victim, except those involving their direct death.  %^BOLD%^%^RED%^Namely, they do not remember who killed them.%^RESET%^  Bearing in mind that revenge killings are illegal, this rule remains for a good reason. Other than this, after the 4 day downtime they are able to remember everything else.

%^CYAN%^Special Note:  %^RESET%^No interaction such as scrying, telling, etc, may take place between the victim and killer until *after* they have seen one another IC and the 4 days time limit has passed.  The only exception is if the time limit has already passed and the killer receives word that is reliable enough for him to believe the victim is still living (not just one person says "Oh, Victim is still alive." but the killer hears from 2 or 3 people or hears word that the victim has done something else).

%^RED%^Feelings/Reactions%^RESET%^
The feelings between killer and victim are adjusted based on a sliding scale.  The scale is:

%^CYAN%^1 - Hate
%^CYAN%^2 - Dislike
%^CYAN%^3 - Neutral
%^CYAN%^4 - Like
%^CYAN%^5 - Love%^RESET%^

Generally speaking, it would take "Hate" for a PC to attack another PC.  The scale is mainly for you to visualize where you are in relation to someone else.  Normally, most people you encounter, you are "neutral" toward.  Once you begin really speaking to each other and maybe travel together a bit, you would probably slide a little more toward "like".  "Love" should be more rare - something that you feel for only a few people.  Those people who simply rub you the wrong way or you have maybe argued with, you would feel "dislike" for.  Hate, like love, will in most cases be rare.  Hate - the feeling strong enough to make you hurt someone else - is not common at all.  It's a strong emotion that is hard for most people to sustain.  Of course, "goodies" may feel more love than "evils" and vice versa with hate.  But the fact remains that these feelings are far stronger - and therefore much more rare - than like and dislike.

Of course, a PC may not always "hate" another PC for them to attack (assassins and such go after bounties, etc) but this is generally what should be followed.  Keep this scale in mind and if you feel like it's someone your PC simply "dislikes", try to think in those terms.  Just because there's someone you know who pushes the wrong buttons with you does not mean you would attack and/or kill that person in real life (at least, we hope not).  The same goes here.  Use these things to help push your rp into new directions.  If you need help or suggestions, we will be glad to post a few.

Anyone, no matter what their relationship before, will feel at LEAST dislike after a PK.  Even if you were in love and married before the PK, afterwards, the victim will feel a strong sense of dislike for the killer - they won't know the reason for it, but they will feel uneasy around the killer and feel the killer "rubs them the wrong way".  If the victim already disliked the killer (they argue constantly, etc), that feeling slides one to hate.  Same thing though - they do not really know why, just that they seem to dislike the person even more now.
