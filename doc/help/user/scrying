%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SCRYING%^RESET%^

Sundering Shadows has many different spells and items that are used to view other players, or listen in on their conversations. Scrying is considered a PK action and should be treated as a potentially hostile action.

There are a few different types of scry spells, as follows:

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SPOT SCRYING:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Clairvoyance, Vision, Find Quarry, Seeing%^RESET%^

These spells will give you a snapshot of the location that the designated target is in, along with the possibility of seeing others in the room with them.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^MIRROR/CRYSTAL BALL SCRYING:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Remote Viewing, Magic Mirror, Ice Mirror%^RESET%^

These spells will give you the ability to watch and listen in real time to the target in question and potentially others in the room with them.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^LISTENING DEVICE:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Prying Eyes/Listening Shadow/Inner Eye%^RESET%^

These spells place an invisible listener into the room with the target, picking up things that are said or done in the room.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SCRY BLOCKERS:%^RESET%^

There are a number of different spells that protect the caster from scrying. There are a few different types:

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^PERSONAL SCRY BLOCKER:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Mind Blank/Impenetrable Veil/Protection From Scrying/Mind Veil%^RESET%^

These spells will place a blocker on yourself, which protects only YOU from being scried. This protects extends to scries cast on others which would normally reveal your presence. These protections do NOT alert you to the scry nor the identity of the scrier. These blockers do not stack with each other. These blockers move with the caster.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^PERSONAL SCRY DETECTION:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Detect Scrying/False Vision%^RESET%^

These spells place a scry detector on yourself, which will detect if a scry attempts to see you in any way. If the opposed roll goes more than 5 in your favor, you will see the scrier's location and description. False vision is somewhat different as it will alert the caster that they were scried, but will not reveal the scrier. Instead, it will damage the scrier with mental damage.

%^BOLD%^CYAN%^AREA SCRY WARDS:%^RESET%^
%^MAGENTA%^BOLD%^Screen/Protection From Scrying%^RESET%^

These spells will place a scry ward on the room itself, offering protection to anyone inside that room. These blockers will not alert when a scry attempt is made. This protection is stationary and does not move with the caster.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^OPPOSED SCRY ROLL:%^RESET%^

When a scry is made against a target, an opposed scry check is made as follows:

%^CYAN%^Opposed Scry Roll:%^RESET%^
%^YELLOW%^Scry Power   = Clevel + Caster Stat Bonus (SCRIER)
%^YELLOW%^Block Power  = Clevel + Caster Stat Bonus (TARGET)
%^YELLOW%^Scry Roll    = Scry Power + d20 VS Block Power + 10

Tie rolls go to the blocker
