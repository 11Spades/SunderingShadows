Ranged weapons

ShadowGate provides a ranged weapon system.  Ranged weapons refer
to weapons that can engage an enemy from a distance.  Here distance
is defined by rooms. Longbows, shortbows and crossbows as well as slings 
and other such items are all thought of as ranged weapons. Things like 
javelins, nets, boulders are ranged weapons but are dealt with separately.

The syntax to using a ranged weapon is
    shoot <target> <direction> <distance> || shoot <target> <direction>
Note:  You must spell out the direction name (i.e. north, south not just 
n or s)

Note it is possible to specify a direction without a distance, this will fire 
at the closest <target> within the range of the weapon. 

This will fire a piece of ammo in that direction. Each weapon has
a type of ammunition. This ammunition can be depleted. The weapons have 
range. This is a concept of both a maximum distance you can fire, and 
distances over which you take penalties. Obviously the farther you fire 
the harder it is to hit something. Once you fire at something, if they 
are not in combat they will seek to find the person attacking them; they 
will move toward your position. If they have friends the friends will come 
too. When they move they cover approximately 1 room per round. (This applies 
to NPCs, PCs are obviously responsible for their own actions)

The bow has a rate of fire set. That is the reload time for an average user. 
During this time an average user can fire 1 shot, a proficient user (100%) can 
fire 2, for specialized users there is an extra shot per 15% to a max of 8 per 
round. 

Fighters can specialize in a ranged weapon the same as any other weapon. This 
would be ideal for creating a crossbowman or an archer.
