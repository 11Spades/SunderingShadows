High Mortal Quest aka Sword Quest
=================
Changes have made this name misleading, as high mortal status is no longer based on levels.  However, this quest is still required to advance beyond level 19.  Please read help highmortal if you have not yet.  

Once you reach level 19, you will be required to complete this quest in order to advance.  The quest begins on the Dragon Pass Road, in a room with an NPC you need to find.  There is more than one quest available and you will be assigned one when you begin.  As with all quests, do NOT just ask someone and do what they did.  With this one, however, that abuse is even more likely to result in failure even without a wiz or avatar noticing it.

Earning the trust and respect that goes with high mortal status is still required at some point in higher advancement, although the guidelines are subject to change and may vary with the situation.  (In other words, don't ask what it is.  If you focus on RPing one main character to the best of your ability, following rules, and earning respect and trust as a player from the beginning with that character, you probably won't notice the later restriction.)
