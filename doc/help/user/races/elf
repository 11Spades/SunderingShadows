%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Elves are one of the most ancient races, said to have come after the dragons. Their history is steeped in magic and learning, and they are renowned for their mastery of sword and bow. They are usually beautiful creatures possessed of unearthly grace, that grow slowly and are extremely longlived, up to more than 500 years old. They reach physical maturity at approximately 25, and emotionally mature by 125. Elves do not scar save by magical injuries, and also tend to be immune to normal illnesses, as only magical ailments tend to trouble them.

As longlived creatures, they tend to take a long time to come to decisions, much to the frustration of shorter-lived companions. They have little care for money, instead taking greater interest in the beauty of art, music, nature, arcanistry, and other such lengthy pursuits. They tend to prefer the company of their own kind first and foremost, and do not make friends easily with others; many look down on shorter-lived races as lesser than themselves.

Elves do not grow any kind of facial hair, and have long ears and wide, almond-shaped eyes. Considered by many to be a beautiful race, they are usually slender and a little shorter than a standard human, with angular features. They do not sleep, but instead enter a waking trance known as the 'reverie', during which they relive parts of their lives (it's difficult to remember several hundred years of life without going over it!). They do not age as humans, retaining their looks from adulthood onwards, except for the rare few that choose to show their age in their features.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Non-playable subraces:

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Avariel: %^RESET%^One of the three eldest elven races, these elves are winged and built much as birds, with hollow bones. They have pale skin and gem-like eyes of green, blue or purple. Their wings are usually white, though black-winged avariel do exist, and their hair color generally matches that of their wings (though variants in hair color such as auburn have been noted). Nearly extinct from ancient wars between themselves and dragonkind, they bear an intense enmity for dragons. They are mostly reclusive and keep to their own kin, to the point that they are seen so little that many scholars dismiss them as nothing more than fairy tales.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Lythari: %^RESET%^One of the three eldest elven races, the Lythari are a kind of lycanthrope, except that they retain complete control over their transformations, and retain their minds while shifted. They are extremely reclusive, and near impossible to find, being so rare in present times that even most elves consider them nothing more than a myth. In wolf form, they leave no impression of danger upon any that view them. They can reach the size of a small pony, and usually have gray or silver fur, and intelligent blue or brown eyes. In their native elven form, their hair color is generally that of their lupine coat, with light blue or green eyes.
