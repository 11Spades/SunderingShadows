%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Also known as duergar, these are the darker cousins of their surface-dwelling kin. While similarly famed for their smithwork, they do not share the good spirits of their cousins, being bitter and cheerless creatures. They take little joy in their work, and only cruel jokes and torments will bring a smile to most duergar. Of all the dwarves, they are the only ones known to have any capacity for psionics, stolen long ago from the illithids. Unlike other dwarves, they tend to be tough and lean, with gray skin and dull black eyes. Both genders are bald, and males have gray beards and moustaches.
