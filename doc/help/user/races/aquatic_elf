%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Low from below the deep, close to ancient leviathans that swam primordial oceans a branch of elvenkin lives. Changed and adapted through the arcane to the deep, this aquatic race of elves haven't been seen on the surface for eons, and rumored to be extinct. As the Silence shut the old powers, curious souls of these species, at times entire cities, rose to the surface to walk the land first time in thousands of years and deal with The Dry. Though more open to contact, they still remain uneasy and unwelcoming towards drywalkers, including their former cousins. Prideful and arrogant, they are by many measures superior to barbaric "civilizations" of The Dry.

Aquatic elves have supernatural affinity towards magic in all of its forms, have a curious attitude towards everything. Secretive without exception, they tend stay close to the own kind, with few ever venturing to speak to the land-dwellers. Those who walk the surface are either exiles, explorers, or diplomatic envoys.

Aquatic elves have morphed elven appearance to fit their sub-nautical lives, with gills, fins, and even tails. Their skin coloration varies from pale white to light cyan and deep green. Many cities there are in the deep, and they all are different in one way or another.
