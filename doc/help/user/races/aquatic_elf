%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Low from below the deep, close to ancient leviathans that swam a branch of elvenkin lives. Changed and adapted by arcane to the seas, this aquatic race of elves haven't been seen on the surface for eons, and rumored to be extinct. As the Silence shut the old powers, curious souls of these species, at times entire cities, rose to the surface to walk the land first time in thousands of years and deal with The Dry. Though more open to contact, they still remain uneasy and unwelcoming towards drywalkers, including their former cousins. Prideful and arrogant, they consider themselves superior to barbaric "civilizations" of The Dry.
