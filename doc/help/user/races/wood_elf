%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Also known as sylvan elves, these creatures have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green or hazel eyes. Hair is usually brown or black, or on rarer occasions, blonde or coppery-red. Wood elves are more elusive than their moon elf cousins, and tend to live in small close-knit tribal communities. They place greater emphasis on physical abilities than on intellectual pursuits, and generally abhor all forms of wizardry. They are far more elusive than their elven cousins, living deep within the forests, but share the moon-elven understanding and tolerance of humans. Wood elves are particularly calm creatures, difficult to surprise and possessed of impressive patience. Among elves, they carry the greatest bond to nature, and generally are uncomfortable in any areas of heavy civilization.
