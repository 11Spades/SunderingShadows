%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:%^RESET%^
Also known as svirfneblin, these gnomes are considered more dangerous, and to some, more vicious than their cousins. However, they are actually of similarly good intentions as their surface kindred. They are, however, distrustful of most outsiders, and may come across as antisocial, having a dour nature that is not given to the humor and openness of their above-ground cousins. They are much given to stealth as a means of survival in their underdark homes, which consist of large, complex cities carved from stone. Their society is divided by sex: women are in charge of food and the running of the city, while the men do the mining and patrols. They have a distinct passion for metalwork and gemcraft (especially rubies) even above that of their surface cousins. Their skin ranges from medium brown to brownish gray, the color of the stone they live within. Males are bald and beardless, while women have stringy hair of dull gray shades through to pale white. Their eyes are black or gray. As a race, they tend more toward neutral alignments than their lighter cousins.
