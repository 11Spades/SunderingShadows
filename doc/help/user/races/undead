%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
"Undead" is a template that can be applied to any living creature in order to transform it into a monster of undeath such as a zombie, animated skeleton, or a vampire, or to creatures that are innately unique such as mohrgs, wights.

Undead use their Charisma score in place of their Constitution score when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special ability that relies on Constitution.

Undead beings are considered abominations in the world of Eera. they are an affront to the natural order, and their mere presence invites destruction. Whether this is true or a folk belief remains a topic for scholars to debate. The common folk that drive most civilizations unilaterally strive to destroy and to end the existence of any undead or necromancer that they encounter. Intelligent undead, too, are never an exception to this rule. The vast majority of them are plagued with insanity, becoming monsters that hate everything living, even if in life they rooted for the side of good. Few ever bother to hold conversations with inferior living beings. They are more likely to destroy both good and evil beings rather than trying to build an alliance with them. Ancient liches, nosferatu, and aswang cannot be communicated with, and they are considered to be enemies to all life.

That being said, to every rule there is an exception. If this exception is supported by divinity, then the variables that governed the world change, and bring new rules into the game. Greater undead, intelligent and sane, are those marked by Nilith's unholy graft. If they do not follow her, they are at least never enemies of the church.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
Playing an undead character gives no meaningful bonuses, and imposes severe punitive mechanical elements onto your gameplay. You will be harmed by most means of healing. Many spells will cause greater damage to you. You will be brought down almost everywhere if you are found to be undead, other players have additional excuse to start pk with you. With all of that, inexperienced players should not consider this path.

The only available template to be gained for players is a necropolitain character. Visually indistinguisable from the living, these are undead dwellers of undead kingdoms raised by Nilith allies and followers.

%^CYAN%^Note: If, for some reason, your undead character is rolled during creation, you begin play with an invisible 16 con score.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: If revealed, you may be attacked on sight and shunned in cities throughout the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation. 

%^CYAN%^Note:%^RESET%^ Undead is an acquired template that may only be gained through RP and avatar-interaction.
