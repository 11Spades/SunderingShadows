%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
%^ORANGE%^"Undead" is a template that can be applied to any living creature in order to transform it into a monster of undeath such as a zombie, animated skeleton, or a vampire, or to creatures that are innately unique such as mohrgs, wights.

%^ORANGE%^Undead beings are considered abominations in the world of Eera. they are an affront to the natural order, and their mere presence invites destruction. Whether this is true or a folk belief remains a topic for scholars to debate. The common folk that drive most civilizations unilaterally strive to destroy and to end the existence of any undead or necromancer that they encounter. Intelligent undead, too, are never an exception to this rule. The vast majority of them are plagued with insanity, becoming monsters that hate everything living, even if in life they rooted for the side of good. Few ever bother to hold conversations with inferior living beings. They are more likely to destroy both good and evil beings rather than trying to build an alliance with them. Ancient liches, nosferatu, and aswang cannot be communicated with, and they are considered to be enemies to all life.

%^ORANGE%^That being said, to every rule there is an exception. If this exception is supported by divinity, then the variables that governed the world change, and bring new rules into the game. Greater undead, intelligent and sane, are those marked by Nilith's unholy graft. If they do not follow her, they are at least never enemies of the church.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
%^ORANGE%^Playing an undead character gives no meaningful bonuses, and imposes severe punitive mechanical elements onto your gameplay. You will be harmed by most means of healing. Many spells will cause greater damage to you. You will be brought down everywhere if you are found to be undead. Thus, inexperienced players should not consider this path.
