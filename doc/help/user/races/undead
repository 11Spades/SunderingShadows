%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
%^ORANGE%^Undead beings are considered abominations on the Eera, an affront to natural order whose mere presence invites destruction. Whether this is a reality remains a topic for scholars to discuss, common folk that drive kith civilizations unilaterally strive to destroy and to end existence of any undead and vile necromancers they encounter. Intelligent undead too never are exception to this rule. Wast majority of them are plagued with insanity monsters that hate everything living, even if in life they rooted for goodness. Few ever bother to hold conversation with living beings.

%^ORANGE%^That being said, to every rule there is an exception. If exception is supported by the divinity previously unknown the variables that governed the world change and bring new rules into the game. Greater undead - intelligent and sane - are those marked by Nilith's unholy graft. If they do not follow her they are never enemies of the church.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
%^ORANGE%^Playing undead character gives no meaningful bonuses and imposes severe penalties. You will be harmed by most means of healing. Many spells will cause greater damage to you. If your undead nature is discovered, you will most likely be attacked on sight. For these reasons, inexperienced players should not consider this path.
