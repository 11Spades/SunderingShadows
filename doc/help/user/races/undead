%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
%^ORANGE%^Undead being are considered abomination on the Eera, an affront to natural order whose mere presence invites destruction. Whether this is a reality remains a topic for scholars to discuss, common folk that drive kith civilizations unilaterally strive to destroy and end existence of any encountered undead and those who create undeath. Even intelligent undead never are exception to this rule. Wast majority of them are plagued with insanity monsters that hate everything living, even if in life they rooted for goodness. Few ever bother to hold conversation with living beings.

%^ORANGE%^That being said, to every rule there is an exception. If exception is supported by the divinity previously unknown the variables that governed the world change and bring new rules into the game. Greater undead - intelligent and sane - are those marked by Nilith's unholy graft. Even if they do not follow her they are never enemies of the church.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
%^ORANGE%^Playing undead character gives no meaningful bonuses and imposes severe punitive mechanical elements onto your gameplay. You will be harmed by the most means of healing. Many spells will case greater damage to you. You will be brought down everywhere if found out to be undead. Thus, inexperienced players should not even consider this path.
