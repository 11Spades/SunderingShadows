%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
%^ORANGE%^Undead can be both an acquired template that is added to any living creature - such as zombies, animated skeletons, vampires, and unique in their own existence creatures - for example mohrgs, wights, flesh golems.

%^ORANGE%^Undead beings are considered abominations in the world of Eera, an affront to the natural order, whose mere presence invites destruction. Whether this is true or a folk belief remains a topic for scholars to debate. The common folk that drive most civilizations unilaterally strive to destroy and to end the existence of any undead or necromancer that they encounter. Intelligent undead, too, are never exception to this rule. Vast majority of them are plagued with insanity, becoming monsters that hate everything living, even if in life they rooted for the side of good. Few ever bother to hold conversation with inferior living beings. Even evil beings, they will likely destroy instead of becoming allies. Ancient liches, nosferatu, aswang can not be communicated with and are enemies to all life.

%^ORANGE%^That being said, to every rule there is an exception. If this exception is supported by the divinity - previously unknown, then the variables that governed the world change, and bring new rules into the game. Greater undead - intelligent and sane - are those marked by Nilith's unholy graft. If they do not follow her, they are at least never enemies of the church.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
%^ORANGE%^Playing an undead character gives no meaningful bonuses, and imposes severe punitive mechanical elements onto your gameplay. You will be harmed by most means of healing. Many spells will cause greater damage to you. You will be brought down everywhere, if found out to be undead. Thus, inexperienced players should not consider this path.
