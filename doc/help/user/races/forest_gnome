%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Forest gnomes are the smallest of the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2.5 feet. They are a shy, secretive folk, who tend to live within the very heart of deep forests, avoiding contact with others except when forced into confrontation. They live in small villages within the trees, and consider themselves guardians of their woods. They are friendly with most forest creatures, and will often help lost travellers, although they do their best to avoid being seen. They look much like regular gnomes, except with dull brown or gray-green skin, darker hair, and their eyes can be brown or green as well as blue. Unlike other gnomes, they also tend to wear their hair and beards long, nearly to the ground.
