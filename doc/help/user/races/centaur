%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Centaurs carry the appearance of well muscled humanoids from the waist up, with pointed ears that suggest they may once have been related to elves. From the waist down, however, they have the body of a horse. Their skin is usually bronzed, with their coat patterning in as many varieties, similar to horses. They can grow from six to eight feet long, and stand at seven to eight feet tall, and weigh anywhere from 950 to 1200 pounds.

Centaurs are usually an honorable and friendly people, with a deep bond to nature. While a generally uneducated people, they are some of the wisest in the ways of their woodland homes, of which they see themselves as the guardians. They live in matriarchal societies, with the mares running the tribes and cultivating food, while the stallions usually serve as hunters and guards. They are generally distrustful of humans, but are quite friendly with most elves.
