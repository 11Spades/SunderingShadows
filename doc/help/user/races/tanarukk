%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Descended several generations after the union of an orc and a demon, these orcs are typically shorter and stockier than the common orc. They appear as savage as they act, with bristly hair, horns, and ridges on their head.  As is common with other evil-aligned planetouched, tanarukks have the distinctive scent of brimstone around them at all times.
