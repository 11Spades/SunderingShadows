%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Water genasi are humans with an ancestor from the plane of water, usually 
an elemental.  They are patient and independant, usually tranquil but at 
times can be fierce and destructive as a storm.  They carry the feeling 
of superiority that is common to genasi, particularly over the sailors 
they sometimes spend time with.  They are most comfortable at sea, and 
can breathe water as well as air, often retreating to underground lairs 
for long spans of time, as they often tend to be loners.  However, they 
do feel kinship with other aquatic creatures.  They tend towards 
neutrality in many things, avoiding extremes in opinion or action.  
Water genasi priests must follow a deity that offers the domain of water; 
this means only Istishia.

Water genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a 
different species, rather than a subspecies of human.  They have the 
appearance of a human except for one or two physical attributes that 
carry over from their lineage.  Some examples are:
-lightly-scaled or clammy skin
-blue-green skin or hair
-large blue-black eyes
-webbed hands and feet
