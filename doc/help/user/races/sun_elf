%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Somewhat less common than their moon-elf cousins, they tend 
to be less social with other races.  They usually have bronzed skin, 
along with golden or green eyes, and hair of blonde, black, or coppery 
red.  They are less inclined to physical pursuits as those of arcanery 
and other intellectual ends.  They are some of the greatest magic users 
in the realms, and are also renowned for their magnificent stonewrought 
towers and spires that form their homes.
