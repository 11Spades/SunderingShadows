%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Somewhat less common than their moon-elf cousins, they tend to be less social with other races. They usually have bronzed skin, along with golden or green eyes, and hair of blonde, black, or coppery red. They are less inclined to physical pursuits as those of arcanery and other intellectual ends. They are some of the greatest magic users in the realms, and are also renowned for their magnificent stonewrought towers and spires that form their homes.
