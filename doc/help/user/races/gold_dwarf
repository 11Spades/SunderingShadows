%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^One of the two most common kinds of dwarf, they are renowned as much for their smithwork as their military prowess, and their legendary stores of wealth. They place importance on divisions of clan and class, with nobility and royal lines providing rulership to their clans and underground cities. Pride and honor is important to them, as the failure of a single dwarf reflects on his entire clan and ancestors. They are terribly fond of riches, and displays of wealth are important to the prestige of a gold dwarf. They tend to hold a great pride in their race, often coming across as aloof to outsiders, of which they are naturally suspicious. With skin of light brown to tan, their eyes are usually brown or hazel. They wear their dark hair long, and both genders sport carefully groomed beards and mustaches. They tend towards lawful alignment.
