%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Kobolds grow only to a height of three feet and have two horns, bright 
red eyes, and dark scaly hides that vary in color from dark, rusty brown 
to a rusty black.  They smell absolutely awful, like they've been in the 
sewers for far too long.  They prefer to wear red and orange clothing 
which is usually very ragged.  They have long, rat-like tails.  Due to 
their small and rather odd appearance, they aren't usually taken 
seriously.  This can be a big mistake because they are incredibly 
ferocious and persisting.

Kobolds prefer to unbalance the odds in their favor and are masters of 
trickery.  They take great joy in killing and accumulating power, and are 
disposed to very cruel natures.  They have many enemies and will usually 
attack gnomes on sight, but must think carefully before attacking humans, 
elves, or dwarves to make sure the odds are in their favor.  They will 
often eat their victims or sell them into slavery, but they will never 
eat gnomes or take them prisoner.  They live in overgrown forests and 
dark, damp places underground.  Kobolds are good miners and are often at 
war with those near their territory.  They will normally leave their 
lairs to waylay other adventurers and gather more treasure.
