%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Kobolds grow only to a height of three feet and have two horns, bright red eyes, and dark scaly hides that vary in color from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell absolutely awful, like they've been in the sewers for far too long. They prefer to wear red and orange clothing which is usually very ragged. They have long, rat-like tails. Due to their small and rather odd appearance, they aren't usually taken seriously. This can be a big mistake because they are incredibly ferocious and persisting.

Kobolds prefer to unbalance the odds in their favor and are masters of trickery. They take great joy in killing and accumulating power, and are disposed to very cruel natures. They have many enemies and will usually attack gnomes on sight, but must think carefully before attacking humans, elves, or dwarves to make sure the odds are in their favor. They will often eat their victims or sell them into slavery, but they will never eat gnomes or take them prisoner. They live in overgrown forests and dark, damp places underground. Kobolds are good miners and are often at war with those near their territory. They will normally leave their lairs to waylay other adventurers and gather more treasure.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
