%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ogres are big and ugly, over 9 feet tall. They are violent and generally ill-tempered. They live by raiding and scavenging, and want everything they see. Ogres can rarely be trusted and will argue with anyone over treasures. They will try to fit in with their traveling companions, although they aren't disposed to sharing whatever the group may find.

Ogrish skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and are very rarely a sickly shade of violet. The warty bumps that cover their bodies are often a different (usually darker) color than their hides. They have purple eyes with white pupils and their teeth and talons are orange or black. They have long, greasy hair that ranges in color from a blackish-blue to a dark green.
