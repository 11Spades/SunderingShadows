%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Typically, ogres stand between nine and ten feet tall and can weigh up to 650 lbs. Their hides range from sickly yellow to a dull blackish-brown, with dark warty bumps, purple eyes, and black or orange teeth and talons. They dress in skins and furs, but keep their weapons reasonably well.

Ogres are rapacious, bestial giants. They are closely related to trolls, and are distantly related to the various races of giants. The runts of the giant litter, they possess little more than feral instincts and brute strength, and they revel in the abuse of things smaller then themselves like cruel children.

Ogres mix freely with trolls, other giants, and orcs. They will also join with gnolls, and have been known to associate with clerics of gods of violence, war, and brutality, and as a result, they occasionally appear in demon armies as well (though typically as slaves).

Ogres are fond of halfling, dwarf, and elf flesh especially. As giants, ogres dwelling in the mountains and hills where dwarves live have been fighting them for millennia.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
