%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Devas serve as warriors in divine legions, though most of their times they patrol feywild, plane of shadows and material plane, battling numerous fell creatures that either inhabit these realms or spawn from The Void at the edge of existence. They rare visits to material plane were usually to aid powerful mortals when a great menace threatens to plunge an entire realm into evil, or to do the deed themselves.

Devas align themselves with good-natured divinities or choose to serve the nature. Altough pacifist in their hearts, they are fearsome soldiers and they will resort to violence if no other choice is left. To avoid conflict they never form civilizations or build cities outside of domain of their patrons. Communicating with beings of material plane devas try to sway their hearts towards peace and good, no matter how lost the cause is.

It is not clear how most of them come into being, but faithful paragon of virtue among mortals after his death often join the ranks of celestial legions. As such, Deva share various traits of humanoid races. Most of them have youthful human-like appearance with large feathered wings trailing behind their back. Devas live long lives that are limited only by dangers of their occupation.
