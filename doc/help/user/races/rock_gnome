%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^The most common of the gnomes, these clan-organized creatures live beneath the earth in burrows, usually in remote areas of hills and forest. They are fun-loving creatures that enjoy a sense of humor, and the occasional prank or friendly rivalry. They have a companionship with animals, particularly those that live within the earth as they do. Their skin is tan to woody-brown, with fair hair and eyes of any blue shade.
