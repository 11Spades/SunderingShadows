%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Moon elves are the most common of the elven subraces, and the most social in regards to other races. They generally have fair skin (often tinged a pale icy-blue towards their extremities), with blue or green eyes, and hair that runs in a scale from silver-white to blue or black. Most half-elves are descended from a moon elf parent, as they are the most likely to mingle with humankind. They are the most impulsive of the elves (although keeping in mind that impulsive for a creature that lives for centuries, may be considered still very slow by human standards). When they settle down they usually live in forest homes, usually built around trees, but they often prefer to travel.
