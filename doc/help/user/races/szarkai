%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai share mechanics with the drow parent race, but are available as a subrace of elves.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Being essentially albino drow, szarkai are virtually indistinguishable from slightly pale moon elves with silver hair. This trait gives them the unique position to be, taking into account their fell society's causitry, diplomats, spies and agents while dealing with the pathetic surface dwellers. Generally regarded with disdain, the szarkai that survive to adulthood are without a doubt beings of considerable power.
