%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai share mechanics with the drow parent race, but are available as a subrace of elves.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Being essentially albino drow, szarkai are virtually indistinguishable from slightly pale moon elves with silver hair. This trait gives them the unique position to be, taking into account their fell society's causitry, diplomats, spies and agents while dealing with the pathetic surface dwellers. Generally regarded with disdain, the szarkai that survive to adulthood are without a doubt beings of considerable power.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: If revealed as Szarkai, you may be attacked on sight and shunned in cities throughout the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
