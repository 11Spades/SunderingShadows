%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai:

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Szarkai share mechanics with drow parent race, but are available as the subrace of elves.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Being essentially albino drow, szarkai are virtually indistinguishable from slightly pale moon elves with silver hair. This trait gives them unique position in drow society to be, taking into account fell society's casuistry, diplomats, spies and agents in deals with pathetic surface dwellers. Being held in slight disdain, those szarkai that survive to adulthood are without a doubt beings of considerable power.
