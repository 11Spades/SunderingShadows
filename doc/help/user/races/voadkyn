%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Voadkyn are also known as wood giants and generally resemble giant-sized wood elves. They are about 9 1/2 feet tall and weigh about 700 pounds, with the same physical proportions as humans. Voadkyn live in forests, extending friendship to wood elves and other elven races. They are frivolous and flighty, giving into sudden whims, but despite their fun-loving, almost irrational nature, they are generally considered to be friendly and enjoyable companions.

Voadkyn are completely devoid of facial and body hair, including eyebrows, beards, etc. and means that all voadkyns are bald. This further emphasizes their overly large heads, even for their size. Their ears are placed higher than those of a human, being almost completely above the line of their eyes and much closer to the top of their head. Their eyes can be almost any shade of brown, often mingled with yellow or green. Their clothes are usually colored to be that of the forest they reside in.
