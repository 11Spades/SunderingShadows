%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
A half-drow's skin tone ranges from light grey to dusky grey. Their eyes glow with the same fire that their elven parents have. Eye color is almost always black or red, but in rare cases it will be blue or brown. Their hair is often white or silver, but it is not unheard of for them to have blonde or brown hair. Their ears are like other half-elves, long and pointed.

Due to their rarity, they have not yet gained the acceptance other cross breeds have over generations of exposure. They are still outcasts in all societies and very few will ever trust them. The drow loathe them, and often kill their parents. Other elves pity them and seek to kill them to end their suffering. Many fear them because of their drow heritage. Although not all half-drow are evil, they tend towards neutral evil: They see the world as a terrible place where they must defend themselves at every corner.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
