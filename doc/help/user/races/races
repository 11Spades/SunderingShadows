Templates are added to your character's race and gives you additional strengths and weaknesses. Those that can be chosen at creation are only available to those with a 30+ character on their account. They are PK races.

Note that any race not rollable at creation is considered a PK race. If your characterâ€™s race changes for any reason, you are considered a PK race if either race (old or new) is a PK race.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ PK races are advanced races that will impose disadvantages upon your gameplay. Many are banned in most major cities and treated with scorn and distrust throughout the realm. They start play with their NOPK flag turned off by default and their presence may be considered a provocation(see <help PK rules>). Enter the realm of PK at your own risk!


%^CYAN%^General Information%^RESET%^

Your race determines your make-up. Some races are predisposed to being stronger, sturdier, more intelligent, more sensitive to light, etc. than other races. In addition, different races are physically different from others, having different limbs and other types of body parts. In real life, you had no choice. You were born human. In Sundering Shadows' reality, you do get a choice. Do you want a magical character? Or do you want to play the game by brute force? Or perhaps deception or skullduggery? What do you prefer to explore? Do you like dark, enclosed areas? Or do you like well lit castles or the open outdoors? All these questions face you now. Whatever choice you make, so long as it fits the style in which you like to play, will be rewarding. There is neither a best pick nor a worst pick. There is only what is best or worst for your style.

Towards that end, here are some clues:
 * Intelligence and wisdom make the best magic users.
 * Strength and constitution make the best fighters.
 * Dexterity and charisma make the best roguish types.

Each race has its own help file. For example, to find out about humans, type %^ORANGE%^<help human>%^RESET%^.

%^ORANGE%^This is not the 20th century and an enlightened society. Racial hatreds and differences, people looking down on bastard half-races (including half-elves) and so forth is a way of life and even a requirement for survival.%^RESET%^
