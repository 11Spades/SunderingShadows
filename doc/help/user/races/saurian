%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Descendants of long-lost creator race and close cousins of the Lizardfolk, Saurinas are race of reptilian-like people originating from small but advanced civilization on the Saurian Archipelago located beyond the reach in the Danger Ocean. Unlike their less civilized cousins, Saurians slowly work together towards the greater good, and due to living in more hospitable environment they live much longer lives than span unlimited by natural causes.

They are undisputed naval power bordering the known world, yet Saurians avoid wars, giving preference to diplomacy and peaceful trade with other races. Their society is based on the rule of elder councils, with age being respected and worshiped. Due to being distant power, they are not well known to other races; Attaya being the only place capable of mutual trade with them.

Saurians can be born with equal chance into two castes of the society: lani-ele, the caste of artisans, magicians, psionists, and hon-ele, the caste of workers and soldiers. Both castes are equal in the society, elders of both rule Saurians.
