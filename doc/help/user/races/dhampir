%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Squoles are relatively new race of sentient para-elemental beings. They don't form own societies and their individual personal goal is always aligned with integration into human society, and so far they have done it well. The first squoles shared the same form that of that of a fit and muscular male human. Later, they adopted an additional form; a slender and well-proportioned female. Due to having humanoid shape and rather neutral personalities they assimilate into human cities without any trouble, taking on vast variety of professions.
