%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Known as ghoul-blooded or half-vampires, those cursed to live as dhampirs know a miserable half-life. Born from mothers infected with vampirism in the final days of their pregnancy or sired by freshly spawned vampire fathers, dhampirs live with remnants of the curse of vampirism in their mortal blood. Although the taint grants these rare souls eerie abilities, such as sensing in the night, so too are they cursed with a measure of their accursed parentsâ€™ ravenous natures, making many just as dangerous, unpredictable and alien as vampires themselves.
