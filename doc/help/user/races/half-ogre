%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Half-ogres are a cross between ogres and humans. They are between seven and eight feet tall, looking like large, ugly humans for the most part. Half-ogres have the strength and size of their ogre ancestors, combined with the intelligence and reason of humans. However, because of their partial ogrish blood, they are regarded with distrust by most other races, and are usually shunned at the least, if not downright attacked or expelled from civilized areas.

Unlike other human crossbreeds half-ogres almost unilaterally inherit ogre phenotype over their human one. Though they can pass as a big humans, traits of their human sub-races are dissolved in much stronger ogre blood. Skin coloration and small rare features of fiendish and celestial blood such as miniature demonic wings or feathered hair can manifest in half-ogres without giving them benefits or any special treatment from the world. Unlike other half-races, people always refer to them as half-ogres.
