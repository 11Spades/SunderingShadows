%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Half-ogres are a cross between ogres and humans.  They are between seven 
and eight feet tall, looking like large, ugly humans for the most part.  
Half-ogres have the strength and size of their ogre ancestors, combined 
with the intelligence and reason of humans.  However, because of their 
partial ogrish blood, they are regarded with distrust by most other 
races, and are usually shunned at the least, if not downright attacked or 
expelled from civilized areas.
