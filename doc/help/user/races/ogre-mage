%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ogre magi are 10 1/2 feet tall and have dark eyes. They usually have 
light blue, light green, or pale brown skin, along with a pair of ivory 
horns on their forehead.  Their hair is usually a different color from 
that of their skin, and is a darker shade (except ogre magi with pale 
brown skin and yellow hair).  They have black nails and dark eyes with 
white pupils.  Their teeth and tusks are usually pure white.

Ogre magi tend to be more civilized than ogres, and live in caves or 
fortified dwellings.  They have a great respect for their clans, 
following many oriental traditions, including dress and weapon use.  Ogre 
magi prefer to use magic rather than force, but they can be just as 
fierce as their ogre relatives.
