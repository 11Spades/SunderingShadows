%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ogre magi are 10 1/2 feet tall and have dark eyes. They usually have light blue, light green, or pale brown skin, along with a pair of ivory horns on their forehead. Their hair is usually a different color from that of their skin, and is a darker shade (except ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair). They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. Their teeth and tusks are usually pure white.

Think of Ogre magi as the monsters under the bed. They're the subject of children's stories typically to make the children behave. In the stories that human children are told, oni find babies and young children extremely delicious.

In Sundering Shadows, Ogre Magi are true monsters. They seek out children and adults alike to abduct and eventually devour them. This is similar to ogres. They desire flesh for sustenance and they'll kill or capture people to satiate their hunger.

However, Ogre magi are magical creatures. They can cast spells and are in tune with the arcane. Ogre magi are particularly excellent shapeshifters and can change their form at their leisure.

Their shape-shifting abilities allow oni to infiltrate an unsuspecting town of humans and blend right in. They can stalk their prey or befriend a group of small children and use their relationship as leverage to take them away and eat them for dinner.

There are several subraces of ogre-magi which define physical appearance.

Water oni usually have blue skin.
Fire oni are three-eyed and usually have red skin.
Void oni have three eyes and ash gray skin.
Kuwa oni have four fingers on their hands and golden skin.


%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
