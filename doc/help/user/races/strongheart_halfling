%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
These halflings tend to settle more into villages and strongholds than their other kindred, and are rarely given to wanderlust the way lightfoot halflings can be. They build and fortify to last, and are also far more martially inclined creatures. They will fiercely defend both themselves and their homelands when threatened, and take great pride in their martial traditions. They are an industrious people, far more organized and orderly than their cousins. Strongheart halflings have dark, straight hair and eyes of brown or black. They tend toward lawful alignments.
