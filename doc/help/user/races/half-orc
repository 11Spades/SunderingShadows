%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Half-orcs are a cross of orcs and human, or other human half-races. They usually take after their orcish heritage, although some can pass as strange looking humans. Their appearance varies depending on their heritage, but tends to lean toward more powerful, muscular builds of the body.

They usually get the worst of both worlds, being distrusted by both humans and orcs, but are valued for their martial prowess. They often must make their way alone and are forced to grow up fast. They seek friendship and acceptance, but are generally shunned by others. They make their way in orcish societies by proving themselves superior in power and ability, or alternatively, they make friends where they can in human societies by associating with those who don't care about appearance or require their unique strength. Feared and distrusted, they lean toward their selfish tendencies, but few manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unforeseen wisdom.

Half-orcs can inherit any traits of human and orcish phenotype. The orcish blood prevents them from inheriting physical and magical traits of their bloodline. Rare subspecies are not more uncommon than their parent race, but quickly dissolve within a couple of generations. If celestial, fey, abyssal, infernal or elemental blood manifests in half-orcs such beings are called half-aasimars, half-fey, half-tieflings or half-genasi respectively.
