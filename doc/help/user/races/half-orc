%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Half-orcs are a cross of orcs and almost any other humanoid race, except 
elves, who they aren't fertile with.  They usually take after their 
orcish heritage, although some can pass as ugly humans.  They are 
distrusted by both humans and orcs, so they often must make their way 
alone.  They seek friendship and acceptance, but are generally shunned by 
others.  They make their way in orcish societies by proving themselves 
superior in power and ability, or alternatively, they make friends where 
they can in human societies by associating with those who don't care 
about appearance.  Most half-orcs tend to be neutral with slight lawful 
and evil tendencies.  A few have managed to form their own half-orc 
societies in remote areas, and these tend to be extremely suspicious of 
strangers.
