%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Dryads are beautiful women with delicate features seemingly made of soft wood. Their hair is madeof leaves and foliage that changes color with the seasons of the calendar. During the spring andsummer months, the hair of a dryad was lush and green, while during autumn it turned red andeventually brown in the winter.

Dryads prefer to live away from civilization, delighting in the savage wilderness away from thosethat sought to cut their trees. They live with respect to nature and accept the company of thosethat do so as well.

All dryads are magically bound to a single tree. These trees serve as the dryad's life force andhome. They will fight to the death to protect their bonded tree, as should the tree be cut ordestroyed, the dryad will die soon afterward. A dryad can not stray too far from her bonded treewithout suffering the same fate. If a dryad left the vicinity of her tree for too long, she dies.

Dryads are generally benign, but as with everything, there are exceptions. Particularly cruelpeople that are determined to destroy a dryad's forest will know the full wrath of these fey, andtheir wrath is no small thing. Being long-lived creatures, a dryad has no shortage of time totorment and utterly destroy their enemies, for generations.

Like a tree that has turned rotten with disease, a blighted, evil dryad will seek to spread theirpain and torment to everything that surrounds them. A dryad turned vile is truly a twistedcreature, and will see entire cities wiped out for even the slightest of offenses. These maliciousfey will destroy a man's heart and home, and do so with a charming smile on their lips.
