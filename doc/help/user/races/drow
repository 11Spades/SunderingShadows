%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Drow elves are a matriarchal chaotic evil society that branched from the elven family many centuries ago. They split from their cousins, the surface elves, in a great war which saw the drow goddess Lolth driven into the bowels of the earth. The drow followed their goddess Lolth, the Spider Queen, into the Underdark. There the drow adapted to their lightless enviroment and, with the blessings of Lolth, they grew in power and quickly became rulers of that dark domain. Drow are ebony skinned, white haired, pointy eared, and are of a size and stature similiar to their light loving cousins. Drow excel in combat, magic, clerical and stealth skills. Their grace in movement is as deadly as their vision in the darkness is unmatched.

Drow are selfish and fell, but do band together against all races. They are taught from birth that all other races are evil and mean the drow harm, therefore, all other races are inferior and must be either destroyed or taken into slavery. The drow fight and kill without remorse or hesitation, unless it is to stop and torture the fallen. The only thing the drow kill more than outsiders are other drow. All subterranean races fear and serve the drow, or hide in fear.

Drow are not tolerated by any surface folk because tales and grisly evidence of their murderous raids have made their way to the surface. The drow's hatred of all other races is only surpassed by the fear and hatred that all other races have for the drow. Afterall, the drow have earned their reputation, and they will be driven out of all civilized surface cities if found in small enough numbers.

Drow have white hair and dark eyes, though their eyes often glow red with infravision. They have ebony skin. They do not like the light, preferring to stay in the dark, inside, or underground, where they are most comfortable.

Drow are extremely difficult to play due to the fact they will be hated and killed by almost all others, including other drow. Only experienced SG players who are also reasonably adept at PK and PK survival and are willing to deal with the setbacks of being PKed often and not cry foul should even consider playing a drow character.
