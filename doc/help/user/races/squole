%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Squoles are a relatively new race of sentient para-elemental beings. They don't form their own societies, and their personal goal is always aligned with integrating into human society, and so far they have done it well. The first squoles shared the same form, that of a fit and muscular male human. Later, they adopted an additional form: a slender and well-proportioned female. Due to having a humanoid shape and rather neutral personalities, they assimilate into human cities without any trouble, taking on a vast variety of professions.

Although the first squoles looked alike, modern variants evolved to mimic the human race very well. They look a lot like humans, despite their flesh being essentially a form of slime, ooze or magma. Diversity among the squoles is found mostly in the color of their "skin", which can come in every color of the rainbow. The race actually consists of three subspecies, each affected by a different aspect of the nearest paraelemental planes, which is reflected in their color and the type of energy that they are at home with. They have very limited affinity to polymorphism, allowing them to slightly adjust the shape of their body.

Squoles are blind by nature, but by using a sensitivity to vibrations, the squole maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature within a limited range. Thus, <peer> command will display only neighboring rooms.
