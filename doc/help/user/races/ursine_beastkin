%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Perhaps the most physically intimidating of the bestial totems of the beastkin, the ursine are large and powerful beings. They are loathe to hurry, expecting that everything will come in its time, and can sometimes be perceived as somewhat lazy. This facade quickly fades if the beastkin is angered, or a threat is levied against their kin, and they will not hold back any trace of their raw power in destroying all perceived dangers.

Covered in a thick layer of fur, beastkin of the ursine totems can be found in all manner of climates, their hide offering an impressive resilience to the elements. They have broad features, and from a distance are almost indistinguishable from their more mundane kin standing on their hind legs, with their limbs ending in long talons. Because of this, they tend to be a little clumsy when it comes to crafts, but they more than make up for it when it comes to cooking and preparing food.

While most ursine tribes are comprised of small families that mostly take care of their own, they come together as a whole during evening mealtimes. The heightened senses of these beastkin along with their voracious hungers means they take great pleasure in cooking all manner of meals, and each family hoards recipes to bring out during festivals or special occasions. In particular, these beastkin tend to have a sweet tooth, putting desserts on an even higher pedestal.
