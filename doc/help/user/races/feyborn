%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
"Feyborn" is a template that can be applied to any living creature in order to transform it into a living being that is infused with magic from the Fey. The transformation is the result from ancient fey ritual magic and is usually given as a blessing to those of the material plane as a reward for service to a powerful fey entity. The transformation happens quite suddenly and can be best identified through unique changes to their physique and changes to their hair based on the type of fey which laid the blessing.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
Playing as a feyborn can be difficult. Due to their unique capability and access to prized faery dust, once found out, feyborn are often hunted for their gift and the power the magic they posess can give to others.

This template is gifted through great service to a Fey:
