%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Human regional ethnicities:

There are a total of nine broad human ethnic groups recognized across the realm, each with a unique history and heritage. Due to this, some have a slight pre-disposition to skills and other abilities that their human kindred in other areas and of different lineages do not.

%^BOLD%^Please note: %^RESET%^Even though certain half-breeds, such as half-elves, may be prompted to choose a human ethnicity, they do not receive the benefits of that region.  The choice is simply a matter of roleplay and fleshing out the character's history.  The other part of their heritage muddles the ethnicity, weakening the ties to the bloodline.
