%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the three subraces, and are far more savage and insular than their cousins, and more attuned with nature. They live within clan groups, and will rarely leave their woodland homes for any reason, abhorring the civilizations of other races. They have minor telepathic abilities, due to the extreme closeness of their kinship. Ghostwise halflings have dark, straight hair and eyes of brown or black. They tend toward chaotic alignments.
