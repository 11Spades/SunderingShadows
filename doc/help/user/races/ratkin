%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ratfolk are small, rodent-like humanoids. Originally native to deep dark and subterranean in dry deserts and plains, they are now more often found in nomadic trading caravans. Much like the pack rats they resemble, ratfolk are tinkerers and hoarders by nature, and as a whole are masters of underworld commerce, especially when it comes to acquiring and repairing mechanical or magical devices. Though some are shrewd merchants who carefully navigate the shifting alliances of black markets and bazaars, many ratfolk love their stockpiles of interesting items far more than money, and would rather trade for more such prizes to add to their hoards over mere coins.

Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash their hoards or flee in times of danger, gravitating toward subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in city slums. They are very vicious and competitive, often viewing their kith as a tools to achieve more wealth, although they do so often to mutual benefit.

Ratfolk don't like and communicate with many races, except for humans, and often develop ratfolk societies dwelling in the sewers, alleys, and shadows of human civilizations, despite being often mistreated or outright prosecuted. Ratfolk find dwarves too hidebound and territorial, and often mistake even mild criticisms from dwarves as personal attacks. Ratfolk have no particular feelings about gnomes and halflings, although in areas where those races and ratfolk must compete for resources, clan warfare can become dogma.
