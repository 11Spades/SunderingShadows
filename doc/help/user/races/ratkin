%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ratkin are lycanthropes that often dwell in urban areas.

Ratkin are typically wiry, twitchy individuals who are a bit shorter than a typical human. Transformed, they take on the shape of a dire rat that is about two feet long from front to back. They can also take on a hybrid appearance, with their head, torso and tail of a rat, but with the rest of their limbs remaining otherwise humanoid.

Ratkin have a strong pack mentality, and they try to avoid living alone. Their lairs are often found beneath urban populations, using the cities above as hunting grounds where they could steal food and wealth from its inhabitants. They steal anything thought to have any value, often accumulating giant piles of junk. In human form, they tend to keep to the seedier parts of cities that serve the strongest alcohol (with the added benefit of drunks making the easiest targets).

Each pack of Ratkin have two castes, the alphas - and everyone else. The alphas tend to be more aggressive and militaristic, wanting to watch the whole world burn. They often sequester themselves away in the underbellies of their societies, plotting for war and developing advanced weapons of war. The rest of the ratkin society content themselves in infiltrating the human cities, working to rot them away from the inside like a withering disease.

Ratkin are weaker than typical humans, but have superior intelligence and cunning. They share the animal instinct of all lycanthropes, and are markedly more dextrous and resilient to disease than humans. They have a distinct weakness to silver weapons.
