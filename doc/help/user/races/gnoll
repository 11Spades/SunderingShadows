%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Gnolls are about 7 1/2 feet tall hyena-like creatures. They live underground and travel in packs. They use fear and intimidation to its full capacity. They will work with other races and overcome their hatred only when it is completely necessary. They dislike any kind of manual labor and are ruled by their hunger. They eat anything warm blooded, but prefer to eat intelligent creatures as opposed to animals because they scream better. Their skin is a greenish gray color, darker around their muzzle, and they have a short mane that ranges in color from reddish gray to dull yellow. They will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, and ogres. If the gnolls feel themselves to be stronger than their partners, however, they will turn on their partners and eat them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, humans, and demi-humans.
