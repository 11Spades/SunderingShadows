%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Simian beastkin are dangerous because they are clever, make use of their environments, and will attack with a surprising ferocity if their family is at risk. With each other, they tend to discuss plans avidly, not afraid to use intimidation (like chest beating) to make their point, but still rely on a democratic process. Cleverness in words or deed ensures the respect and praise of their kin, and each simian works to hone a talent. On the whole, their crafting talents with wood and bone are impressive, achieving intricate details in even the most fragile of materials. Simians are perhaps most approachable of the various totems, as they are willing to trade with some outsiders, but one should be careful not to insult or harm any one of their family members. They will remember such a trespass, adding it to their collective orations to remind their tribe for generations to come.

The beastkin of the simian totems can take a varied array of shapes, some possessing prehensile tails and appearing closer to monkeys while others are bigger and stockier, more akin to the great apes. Regardless, they are all covered in a thin layer of fur ranging from blacks, grays, browns, and reds, though some even have greenish or olive tones. They are equally adept with their hands and feet, often transferring tools effortlessly between both as they work.

Life among the simians can be more leisurely as omnivores, gathering the bounty of the wilds even as they hunt for meat. This affords them time to focus on crafts, their camps often more decorative then that of other beastkin totems. Given their emphasis on their artwork and socializing with one another, it’s no surprise that the most favored activity for a simian is to groom each other’s fur, and talk about whatever comes to mind. Discussion and a well told story are held in high regard, and many an evening is spent as the elders regale the tribe with stories of their ancestors.
