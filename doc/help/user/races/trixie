Trixies like to call themselves the children of two souls. The product of relationships between gnomes and pixies, trixies are only extremely rarely the result of actual physical coupling and are instead often the unexpected results of centuries-old friendships. Gnomes and pixies can make natural companions, sharing a love of fun, new experiences, and an affinity for the natural world that gives them a lot of common ground. When these friendships last, and they can last for quite some time, especially if the two become travel companions, a curious event sometimes occurs, after a few centuries or a particularly close experience between the two that cements deep emotional intimacy. The pixie coughs out a small seed, which shimmers with magical power and "sings" subtly.

Trixies can be mistaken for gnomes with wings, and indeed some play themselves off as the victims of magical accidents for a laugh (or to disguise their nature for whatever reason). Trixie skin and hair colors can vary wildly and have no consistency whatsoever. Unlike gnomes, trixies trend towards consistent facial features, delicate, angular faces, wide eyes, sharply pointed ears and naturally short hair are all common, the legacy of their pixie heritage. Trixie wings are much smaller than they seemingly should be, and though they flutter expressively they do not enable true flight until the trixie shrinks down in size. Trixies blend the features of both of their parents very smoothly, and the overall result is often attractive in a slightly unsettling way.
