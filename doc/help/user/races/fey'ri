%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^Fey'ri are to elves as tieflings are to humans, distant descendents of the union between a sun elf and a fiend. Unlike tieflings, all fey'ri can trace their ancestry back to a few specific sun-elf houses in history - Heasirretyn and its allies - who were outcast from Selu'havessthor during the Purge. As such, they retain the ancient historyand attitudes of the sun elves of this once-great civilisation, coupled with a longstanding superiority complex and a grudge for being outcast andabandoned by their kin.

Physically, fey'ri retain a similar appearance to their sun elf ancestors,but all also sport batlike wings that clearly set them apart. They also carry one or more additional traits to mark their fiendish heritage. Thesemay include fiery red eyes, fine scales all over the skin, a long pointed tail, batlike ears, or deep red skin. While this would usually be a dead giveaway as to their nature, they have learned over time to take on an alternative form as a normal elf, hiding their fiendish traits from view.In this way, many take on missions of espionage amongst normal elves, gathering information to support their own evil ends.
