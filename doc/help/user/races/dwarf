%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Dwarves are short, stocky humanoids typically characterized by their strength and strong constitution. They usually have a ruddy complexion and dark eyes and hair. They keep long beards that they will often braid or decorate so as to keep it out of their way in a good fight, which they love. Dwarves are rather pessimistic and sour and care little for humor, but they are also very hard working. They enjoy a strong drink and love precious metals and gems which they mine in their mountain homes. They also love the earth and have a strong dislike of the sea and other bodies of water. They are not particularly fond of horses because they are hard to ride with the stocky build of a dwarf, but they do not have a problem with ponies. They also have a strong dislike for arcane magic, for which they have no affinity. They are not fond of elves and they hate orcs and goblins with a passion. With the exception of their duergar cousins, most dwarves are of good alignment.
