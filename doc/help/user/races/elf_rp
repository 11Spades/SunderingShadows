%^WHITE%^~*~*~*~*~*~%^GREEN%^What it is to be an elf? %^WHITE%^~*~*~*~*~*~

%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Elves are magical beings, longer lived than humans for a reason. They (or so they think) are partially divine (they believe that they were the first mortal beings ever created by the blood and tears of two gods (in elven culture they are referred to as Corelleon and Sehanine, though in SG terms Lathander and Selune are used).  Thus, they feel that they are either above the other races, are better than them, or if they do not feel this completely, they think that they have a better understanding of the world than others due to their innate magical/divine aspects as well as their long lives.

%^CYAN%^Elves are generally Good, more often than not, Chaotic Good. They value individualism, and while they do not often feel like they have to directly interfere in the life of another elf, sometimes they have to for that elf's own benefit.

%^CYAN%^Since they have such long lives, they tend to value things that last long: like music, fine artifacts and objects. Things that are transient have little meaning for them (like money or something that would deteriorate quickly).

%^CYAN%^They tend to seek out the company of other elves more because shorter lived races do not have the same perspective that they do. Think about what it would be like to live for 150 years and have a friend mature and get old on you in 25 years, which is a fraction of your life. This is the elven perspective. This is also one reason why Elves think they are 'better' than shorter lived races. They live so short and can't understand the long term goals that elves set.

%^WHITE%^~*~*~*~*~*~%^GREEN%^What do elves like/dislike?%^WHITE%^~*~*~*~*~*~ 

%^BLUE%^Well first and foremost, since elves are creatures of spirit, they HATE undead and things like that. They are also people of the natural world, and undeath is unnatural, so they feel it is a taint and an abomination. 

%^BLUE%^They dislike Drow, because the drow were elves who turned their back on everything elven. Drow means 'traitor' in Elven languages.  Orcs are another racial enemy of elves, a blood feud that is only eclipsed by the Drow.

%^BLUE%^Elves tend to like open spaces, the sky, forests, natural places. 

%^BLUE%^All elves would seek the brotherhood of other elves over the companionship of 'lesser' races. They share the bonds of Race (elven), Time (long lives), Spirit (divine/magical creation). Some elves have more of a tolerance or like of other races for various reasons (they may be amused by them, or fascinated). Usually the younger elves, who do not completely understand what it is like to live so long are the ones that associate more with younger/shorter lived races.  Generally, the older the elves get, the more they want to associate with their own kind, even if they did associate with humans more.. the humans tend to die and age on them and that could be difficult for an elf to deal with.

%^BLUE%^All elves feel a sort of brotherhood with one another because of those things I mentioned. Since humans and other races breed and age so quickly, they have begun to outnumber the elves significantly. Thus the elves often seek to protect themselves and their lands from non-elves, because their numbers dwindle and human numbers rise.

%^BLUE%^Every elf feels a strong kinship to other elves for the reasons I mentioned above (long life, perspective, divine creation) and they would strive to protect what the elves stand for and the elven way of life.
