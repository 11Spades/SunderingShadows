%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:%^RESET%^
%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^You are one of a multitude, either some ratkin that has been blessed/cursed with the disease to enable infiltration, or a human seen as useful enough to infect and conscript into the clan. The instinct to adhere to your clan or pack or warren is strong, enhanced by the disease coursing through your veins. As a creation of the ratkin, your service will be expected by the ratkin. Disobedience would be seen as a failure, with a need to destroy the failed experiment by your furry brethren.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Weretiger is an acquired template and has to be either set by an imm or selected during creation by players with an advanced player account (an account with a L30+ character).%^RESET%^
