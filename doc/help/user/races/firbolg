%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Firbolgs look like normal humans on a much larger scale. They are about 10 1/2 feet tall and 800 pounds, and wear their hair long with long beards. Their skin is typically a fleshy pink, and can have any of the normal human shades of hair color, but are most commonly blonde or red. They dislike using shields to fight, and prefer to have a large two handed weapon. They distrust most other civilized races, and so they avoid them by living in the forests and hills. They do keep on good terms with elves, although not overly friendly. They do not attack or kill without reason and are extremely confident and fearless.
