%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
The satyr's lower body is like that of a goat, with hooves and a tail, and they grow a pair of long horns on their head. Males often grow well-groomed beards. Originating from the Feywild, satyrs are creatures of chaotic mischief. They tend to fill their lives with hedonistic pursuits, and they live in small clans or among other races. They prefer natural environments, seeing the world and everything within it, including other people, as a toy to enjoy. They love endless parties, cheerful company and open sky above them. They are friends to elves and gnomes. Satyrs tend to avoid fell races in general.
