%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Trolls are a race of giants said to be native to this world. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, and astonishingly strong—combined with their claws, their strength allows them to literally tear apart flesh to feed their voracious appetites. More beast than intelligent beings, they, however, sometimes form clan-like communities, taking shelter either in massive caves, abandoned fortresses, or building wooden forts in lush areas. Some trolls are adept blacksmiths and form clans around their trade. Most trolls are violent in nature, but there are Trolls who rather have a peaceful life.

There are many breeds of trolls, but it is troll's appetite and its regenerative powers make it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge headlong at the nearest living creature and attack with all of its fury. Only fire seems to cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal threat is not enough to stop a troll’s advance. Those who commonly battle with trolls know to locate and burn any pieces after a fight, for even the smallest scrap of flesh can regrow a full-size troll given enough time. Fortunately, only the largest part of a troll regrows in this way.

Verious types of trolls have different relationships with civilized races. While moss trolls tend to prefer peaceful existence, rock and hill trolls are nearly universally feared. Trolls, as beasts without preferences, rarely pose a direct threath, but it is not uncommon for member of any other race to avoid known places of troll habitation.
