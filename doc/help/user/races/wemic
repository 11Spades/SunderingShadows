%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Wemics are a combination of human and lion, having a human torso that extends from a lion's body. They can grow to ten feet long and six or seven feet tall. Most of their body is covered in a dusky golden fur, though pure black wemics also exist. Their tail is tipped with a brush of long, black hair. Adult males have a mane of long black hair that extends down to their shoulders. Their underbelly is covered in short, white fur, and their leonine nose is either black or russet. Their eyes are usually golden, and are set with cat-like pupils. All of their fingers end in claws, which are retractable on their forelegs. They are playful and curious creatures, yet are also very dedicated to a cause once they take it up. Good as both trackers and guides, they will sometimes offer their services in exchange for money or magical items.
