%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
These halflings most resemble elvenkind, with slender and 
graceful frames, and slightly pointed ears.  Friendly and 
openminded, they can be inclined to wanderlust at times, and are the most 
commonly-encountered subspecies of halfling.  Originally of the same 
appearance as their cousins, with dark hair and eyes, they have long 
since adopted traits from the many species they have intermingled with 
(primarily humans).  For this reason, they tend to display as much 
variance in hair and eye color as humans.  However, they still tend 
towards lighter frames and more ruddy skin tones, and have curly hair 
covering the tops of their feet.
