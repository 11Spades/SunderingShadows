%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^One of the three eldest elven races, and equally reclusive as their early cousins. They tend to be a stealthy, feral species much more primitive than other elven kind, and known as the 'wild' cousins of other more distinguised elves. They tend towards relatively stocky frames, for an elf, with dark brown skin. Their hair ranges through shades of black and brown, fading much in the way of humans to a silvery-white as they age.
