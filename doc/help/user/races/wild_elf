%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^One of the three eldest elven races, and equally reclusive as their early cousins. They tend to be a stealthy, feral species much more primitive than other elven kind, and known as the 'wild' cousins of other more distinguised elves. They tend towards relatively stocky frames, for an elf, with dark brown skin. Their hair ranges through shades of black and brown, fading much in the way of humans to a silvery-white as they age.

They are also known as green elves, and there are rumors of tribes on Laerad and in the mountains bordering the Tsarven Empire, as well in the Wildlands. Given their low numbers, they are very xenophobic and tend to keep to themselves, living in humble abodes within the forest. These abodes would blend so well into nature, an adventurer could pass through the village and never even notice. A wild elf would never tell an outsider the location of their home, for to do so is to invite destruction.

Wild elves have a very strong and wealthy oral tradition, dating back thousands of years. The legends provide guidelines for moral conduct and ethics, as well as day to day activities. The songs may be used in worship, to inspire courage and skill, or to invoke the tribal spirits, often in synchrony with dance. The Green elves enjoy festivities and often pay tribute to nature by way of song and dance. The solstice feasts are of particular importance. Peculiarly, they are averse to writing things down or making permanent pieces of art, believing that to make something permanent is to destroy the very soul of its creation. Likewise, their equipment is often simple and easily dismantlable, but every bit as potent as that of their more civilized counterparts.
