%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Named by Zin'Charu explorers as Barrus, reclusive and small community of peaceful deep jungle dwellers rarely shows itself to the outside world. Living in depth of warm, remote forests they rarely are presented with an option to adventure beyond. Haathyo, as they call themselves, are driven by legends and stories, ancestor worshiping governs their motives whether they desire or not, these forces bind them to the land, thus it is nearly impossible to see one venturing out of jungle by own will.

Barrus look like humanoid elephants -- large, with head of the beast, they stand out in the crowd. They have an elephant trunk they can use to  can grasp things with, and you can use it as a snorkel. lt has a reach of 5 feet, but hardly can be used as a substitute for hands. Their builds is usually powerful and muscular. However, variants apply as with any race.

Their usually peaceful demeanor can hardly be broken, and ancient knowledge keep all envious races at a safe distance, thus they lack any natural enemies and barely engage in warfare.
