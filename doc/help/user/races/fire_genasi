%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Fire genasi are humans with an ancestor from the plane of fire, usually an elemental. They are mercurial, proud, and often fearless, having truly earnt the reputation of being hot-blooded and quick to anger. They love to dress flamboyantly, and take pride in their individuality. Considering themselves above normal humans, they are never content to simply let the world pass them by. Some do not survive childbirth due to their physical traits (which some misjudge as demonspawn), and physically it is obvious that they are not entirely human. Fire genasi priests prefer to follow a deity that offers the domain of fire.

Fire genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a different species, rather than a subspecies of human. They have the appearance of a human except for one or two physical attributes that carry over from their lineage. Some examples are:

 - charcoal-gray, deep-red, or unusually warm skin
 - red or orange hair that waves like flames
 - eyes that glow when angered
 - large red teeth
 - always smells like smoke
