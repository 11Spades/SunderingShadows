Newbie Ambassador

Newbie "ambassador" is a special role available to players who have achieved the trust level of a hm and wish to help with getting new players off to a better start as newbies.  It has some similarities to what avatars do, but is much more limited in order to keep the focus on helping new players by example.  The main intent is to insure they are getting some good exposure to RP early and learning to RP, explore, and learn how to play the game as intended rather than hack and slash or like a video game to be beaten or blazed through.  It is also to nudge older players making new characters to slow down and begin their character development in Offestry and RP with others there rather than hack and slash through it.

How it works once a person is approved to become an ambassador
--------------------------------------------------------------
Create one or more newbie characters

Notify an immortal that they are one of your ambassador characters (and who your hm is)

A special item will be provided that gives you the ambassador line to share with immortals and other special commands, restricted to use only on other newbies

Play each special character as an actual newbie but with the following goals:
  * interracting with other newbies to stimulate RP in general
  * help/nudge them to think about and RP their character as an adventurer based on their alignment, race, class(es), etc.
  * help/nudge/challenge them to think about the character's beliefs, background, personality development, god(dess) to follow....
  * help enforce RP by reporting any who are not appropriately responsive or you suspect of cheating or ignoring rules to immortals via the line or notes/mail if none are available
  * help new players learn game mechanics, perhaps some language instruction, demonstration of RPing learning nwps, interracting with NPCs, and generally helping them get off to a better, more fun, and less lonely/frustrating start
  * keep the character as long as practical/useful without arousing suspicion - it is to be suicided when it's outlived its usefulness and without advancing out of newbiehood
  * help them learn, by setting an example, to truly explore, search, avoid cycling, learn the value of (appropriate) parties and how to work together in them
  * it is NOT to give them gear, show them where things are, or help them just level
 
These characters will be noted as ambassadors and will not be eligible to advance past newbiehood to become normal PCs.    More than one character is allowed (if you want) so you can cover a few classes, alignments, races, levels and log in whatever is most likely to be a good fit for the newbies on at the time (much like the avatars have personas that they switch in and out of for special situations).  

Note, as you know, we do not want to encourage true newbies to start with the more difficult to RP races, so you should stick with combos we would want newbies to use and make it clear by example how unaccepted the lower races are, etc. with those rather than make a drow to RP with a newbie drow as a fellow drow.  Instead, try to make them feel hated and outcast and force them to deal with that type reaction even though pk is not an option.  Many of them will be experienced players anyway, so they especially should be practicing their role and developing their character there and respond accordingly.  If they aren't, they are doing a disservice to the true newbies and we want to know and deal with that too.

The special line will allow you to get suggestions from other immortals as to where to find the other newbies that are on so as to more readily get to them to initiate RP, request NPC interraction on occasion, and know if there are other ambassador characters on at the time.  We would generally expect to have only one or two Ambassador characters logged in at a time, depending on the number of newbies of course.  We do not want main characters neglected and hms of course will continue to help answer newbie line questions.  This position is strictly to spend time RPing with the newbies and making life in Offestry more interesting and the learning curve easier for new players.
****************
Note:  This will not be advertised to the general player base and should not be discussed with anyone who is not a hm since, as with avatar personas, part of the point is to keep them from being suspected as being different than any normal PC.  The whole point is for the other players to perceive and treat them just as any other newbie so we get a true picture of their RP (or lack thereof).
