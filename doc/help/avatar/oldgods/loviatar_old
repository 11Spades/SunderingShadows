%^BOLD%^%^RED%^%^Day to Day Actives - %^WHITE%^%^Loviatar likes to be feared, and her clergy members are ordered to whisper of her ever-present power in the darkness after they have inflicted pain.  Their Prime Charge is to tirelessly cause suffering, both widespread and personal.  This work may be as brutal as flogging a band of orcs until they flee or as subtle as poisoning the food or drink of someone who has slighted them in some fashion, causing them a slow and agonizing downward decline before offering them the antidote, maybe. Only by offering her gifts or prayers can one hope to avoid the pain and suffering that Loviatar brings, her clerics are often heard saying.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^WHITE%^The faith of Loviatar makes regular use of undead to torture and inflict pain and misfortune on others.  After all, undead are just another instrument in the symphony of pain that Loviatar provides for her followers. 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests -%^WHITE%^ Novices or postulants of the Faith of Pain are known as Kneeling Ones.  Confirmed priests use the titles (in ascending order): Taystren, Adept in Pain, Sister/Brother in Torment, Supremar, Caresser of Terrors, Whiplass/Whiplar, Paingiver, Whip of Misfortune, Whipmaster/Whipmistress, High Whipmistress/Whipmaster, Branded of the Goddess, and Truescar.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^WHITE%^Loviatans of both genders wear high black boots, black choker gorgets, and long black gloves that reach up to their shoulders.  They also wear daring-looking leather body harnesses over or under side-slit ritual robes of icy white or black lined with scarlet silk (so that movements cause red flashes that look like blood).  Priests and priestesses of Loviatar tend to stick with the black or white, and red color scheme when dressing for adventure, though they adopt what ever garments best serve them to spread the influence of Loviatar.%^RESET%^
