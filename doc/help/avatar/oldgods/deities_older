%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^The world of ShadowGate is pantheistic 
and includes many gods who may be worshipped by 
mortals.  While any mortal may make offerings to any 
god to appease him, each mortal is also encouraged 
to choose a patron who will help guide the mortal's 
life.  The gods are based on the Forgotten Realm's
pantheon, with some modification.  These are the gods
and their spheres of influence.
