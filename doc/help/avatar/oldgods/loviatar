%^BOLD%^%^RED%^History - %^WHITE%^For long centuries, Loviatar held her stranglehold upon the both tormented and their tormentors, spreading pain and misery across the realms. Yet as the years dragged on, it seemed even those of the most sadistic inclinations would bow their heads to other greater powers, leaving Loviatar weakened for lack of faithful. Seeing this wane in power, followers of both dark and light often took it upon themselves to put down the her unpopular followers, leaving her yet weaker still.
%^BOLD%^Opportunity, it seemed, was there for the taking as the powerful mortal Durias took it upon himself to challenge the might of a god, in the dead of a summer's night in 681 SG. Recounts of the battle are sketchy at best, with some claiming that Loviatar was too weakened by this point to be even a challenge for one such as Durias. Others claim that even with his power, he could not help but be cast aside by the Maiden's divine wrath, and that only the support of Shar herself won the day.
%^BOLD%^Whatever the case, the scream was heard across the realm as Loviatar finally succumbed to the might of a mortal. With their prayers no longer answered and their enemies closing in, what few faithful remained scattered to the winds and were slain or went into hiding. Rumors tell that yet others joined the cult of the now-ascended Durias, a demi-god in his own right. The temple was ransacked, dragging the final glory of the Maiden of Pain into the dirt and leaving behind only tales of the horrors once committed in her name.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Former Day to Day Activities - %^WHITE%^%^Loviatar liked to be feared, and her clergy members were ordered to whisper of her ever-present power in the darkness after they had inflicted pain.  Their Prime Charge was to tirelessly cause suffering, both widespread and personal.  This work may have been as brutal as flogging a band of orcs until they flee or as subtle as poisoning the food or drink of someone who has slighted them in some fashion, causing them a slow and agonizing downward decline before offering them the antidote, maybe. Only by offering her gifts or prayers could one hope to avoid the pain and suffering that Loviatar brought, her clerics were often heard saying.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^WHITE%^The faith of Loviatar made regular use of undead to torture and inflict pain and misfortune on others.  After all, undead were just another instrument in the symphony of pain that Loviatar provided for her followers. 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests -%^WHITE%^ Novices or postulants of the Faith of Pain were known as Kneeling Ones.  Confirmed priests used the titles (in ascending order): Taystren, Adept in Pain, Sister/Brother in Torment, Supremar, Caresser of Terrors, Whiplass/Whiplar, Paingiver, Whip of Misfortune, Whipmaster/Whipmistress, High Whipmistress/Whipmaster, Branded of the Goddess, and Truescar.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^WHITE%^Loviatans of both genders wore high black boots, black choker gorgets, and long black gloves that reached up to their shoulders.  They also wore daring-looking leather body harnesses over or under side-slit ritual robes of icy white or black lined with scarlet silk (so that movements caused red flashes that look like blood).  Priests and priestesses of Loviatar tended to stick with the black or white, and red color scheme when dressing for adventure, though they adopted what ever garments best served them to spread the influence of Loviatar.%^RESET%^
