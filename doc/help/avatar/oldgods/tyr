%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Day to Day Actives - %^BLUE%^Priests of Tyr serve as judge, jury, and executioner in wilderness areas where there is no law but that of the sword. If a being is truly ignorant of the proper behavior, minor transgressions can be forgiven once with a warning, an explanation of the proper law - and a record of the warning being written down in the priest's Book of Lawgiving for later distribution to other Tyrans so that the particular being will not be forgiven twice. Tyrans often go about lecturing others on their shortcomings as to following laws, rules, and regulations, but they also serve to fearlessly take complaints about such formalities to the authorities who make the laws. No Tyran will enforce a law that contradicts other laws or can be shown to be unjust. Priest of Tyr have the duty of delivering just vengeance as punishment on the part of those who cannot do it themselves. Tyrans undertake formal missions to do this, making promises to those to be avenged and forcing open confrontations with that the vengeance is to be visited upon, rather than working behind the scenes.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Regards to Undead - %^BLUE%^The faithful of Tyr would never create or use undead, as doing so breaks not only the laws of communities, but the laws of nature as well.  When undead are encountered, the Tyranns seek to destroy them first before hunting for those that created them, to make them stand trial for their crimes.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BLUE%^The Church of Tyr is a highly organized, formal priesthood that maintains internal rules and a system of fortified temples.  Level titles used by the clergy in order of ascending rank are: Acolyte of Laws, Solemn Brother/Sister, Lawkeeper, Sword of Tyr, Hammer of Tyr, Vigilant Watcher, Just Captain, Avenger, Master Avenger, Abbot, High Lord Abbot, High Avenger, Knight Commander, Hammer Lord, Defender of Justice, and Keeper of the Balance.  Maverick titles are few indeed, as this is a closely regulated priesthood.
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The Hammers of Grimjaws is the most popular and respected knightly order within Tyr's faith. Paladins of the Just God are front-line warriors in the battle against evil and untruth, and often lead military and adventuring groups to further their cause.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Vestments - %^BLUE%^The vestments of Tyrans are blue and purple robes with a white sash.  A white glove or gauntlet is worn on the left hand and a black one on the right to symbolize the loss of the god's right hand.  When out in the field, most priest of Tyr wear armor or practical clothing adorned on the shoulder and back with the symbol of the hammer and scales of Tyr.%^RESET%^
