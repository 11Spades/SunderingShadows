%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Day to Day Actives - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The clergy of Shar seem to pursue practical, local goals designed to further the power of the priesthood and of those who worship Shar, rather than to openly oppose other faiths (save that of Selune). Shar desires to bring all humans under her sway by promoting general lawlessness and strife. In this way, most folk will suffer loss and turn to her for peace (especially through vengeance), and the influence of all other faiths will be lessened. Shar's clergy always act through manipulations and behind-closed-doors intrigue. They also work through and support shadowy organizations that appeal to human desires to be a part of something elite and important, to keep secrets, and to be involved in the mysterious.

%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Regards to Undead - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Sharran make frequent use of the undead in their war against the forces of Selune.  Nothing delights a follower of Shar more than to animate the bodies and corpses of loved ones or known friends of those they go against. 

%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ Most Sharran clergy use such titles of address as "Brother/Sister of Night",  to superiors they say "Mother/Father Night".  Their formal titles include Adept of the Night for novices, Watcher, Hand of Shar, Darklord/Darklady, Nightseer, and Flame of Darkness (a title only granted by Shar herself to a priest).
%^MAGENTA%^The Dark Justicars is an order inside the faith composed of cavaliers and holy knights dedicated to leading Shar's forces against the Selunites, and other foes of the Mistress of the Night.
%^MAGENTA%^The Nightsinger's faith has found itself with a gathering of rangers.  These natural warriors opperate at night, seeking to remind people why they should fear the darkness.  Some are found as well living in deep caves, pushing back those who would defile the darkness.

%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^Vestments - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The colors purple and black are used extensively in Shar's church and among her followers.  Most Sharran clergy dress in black cloaks or soft, silent dark garb with purple trim, piping, or accessories during rituals.  High ceremonial dress for those of rank or taking a special role in a ritual is a long-sleeved robe of deep purple over black tights or a black velvet chemise.  A black skullcap covers the entire head, except on women with jet-black hair.  Such hair is seen as a symbol of the Dark Lady's pleasure and is left to flow unfettered and long.  Sharran clergy wear practical clothes in the fashion of the land while pursuing day-to-day life.  They are found of jewelry fashioned from obsidian, black onyx, amethyst and purple jade, but they are not required to wear it.  %^RESET%^
