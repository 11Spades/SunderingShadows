%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^History - %^WHITE%^Cyric really came into his own during the Godswar by personally murdering a number of gods and adopting their portfolios.  It is generally assumed by scholars that Cyric was once mortal, although there are hundreds of myths regarding his birth and apotheosis within the faith, and some claiming he has always been divine and due to his "humility" allowed himself to be born to a mortal.  What is universally accepted is the his near universal emnity for the rest of the pantheon, except for a handful of token alliances.  Cyric's faith is disturbingly popular among the megalomanical, the insane, assassins, and necromancers.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Day to Day Activities - %^WHITE%^Priests of the Dark Sun are pledged to spread strife and work holy murder everywhere in order to make folk fear and believe in Cyric. They indulge in intrigue in every land so as to spread strife everywhere without plunging realms into widespread war and thus giving worship only to Tempus, the war god.  Cyricists spend most of their time scheming against each other in an endless struggle, with each priest striving to strengthen his or her own personal power. Cyric speaks often to his faithful clergy, but not with one voice - what he says often sets different churches at cross-purposes and different Cyricist priests at each other's throats as much as it promotes the defeat of other religions.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Regards to Undead - %^WHITE%^The faith of Cyric makes regular use of the undead.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Titles Given to Priests -%^WHITE%^ Given the faith is always in flux, and senior members can die or fall from grace at any time, there is no true titles given to priests.  Common titles used though are Master, Hand of Cyric, Watchful Skull, and Dread Death. 

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Vestments - %^WHITE%^Priest of Cyric dress in black or dark purple robes, with or without hoods, trimmed with silver.  Silver bracers or bracelets (usually adorned with the stamped skull and sunburst) are worn on the wrists to symbolize the enslavement to Cyric.  Some priests paint the symbol of Cyric on their cheek or foreheads on high holy days.  When adventuring priests of Cyric are fond of going about in disguise and love using illusions that alter their appearance when they can obtain them.  They dress either to be inconspicuous or to impress, awe, and/or terrify, depending on what they are assigned to do.  When dressed to terrify they love black armor with ornamentation that looks menacing, such as spiked shoulder and elbow pieces and helms in the shape of snarling monsters.%^RESET%^
