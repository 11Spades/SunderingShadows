%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History - %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Known as the founder of modern psionics, he is rumored to have once been mortal and achieved apotheosis after his enlightenment.  His faith was long confined within Lirremar and has only become known outside the Tsarven Empire since the 660s SG.  Auppenser himself has remained enigmatic and open to the individual interpretations of his followers, and will likely continue to remain so.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Followers of Auppenser may be found in any variety of activity.  Each follower believes himself to have a path to his own enlightenment, and he will follow that path to the exclusion of almost all else.  Depending on their natures, followers of Auppenser can be helpful or cold, cheerful or somber.  Some Auppenseran believe that their call is to help those less fortunate, while others may believe that all are beneath them and subject to their whim.  

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead - %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Auppenser cares not if his followers make use of undead or not, just as long as they do not go against their doctrine, for his wish is only that the individual be true to themselves.   Those who are good and most neutral priests dislike them, while those with darker souls might find them useful.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Titles Given to Priests - %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Priests of Auppenser are known as Psiarchs.  High level priests are referred to as Most Enlightened with the most senior clergy being titled Ascended Minds.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Auppenser's knightly order, simply known as the Sibylline, are the martial arm of the faith, enacting the will of the Psiarchs under which they serve, and protecting the faithful of their lord.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Those who follow the Lord of Reason dress within a wide range from austere to elegant.  In general though, Auppenserans dress for ritual in light robes of cyan, blue or black, each bearing the bronze eye symbol of their god, and many with trim or piping of the same.  Often times the senior most clergy adorn enchanted 'third eyes' upon their foreheads, as a symbol of the inner eye in honor of their god, each gifting the wearer with a variety of psychic powers.
