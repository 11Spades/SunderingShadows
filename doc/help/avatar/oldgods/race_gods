%^YELLOW%^Some longer-lived races still remember those lesser gods who smiled upon them, back before the Godswar sundered the realms and left only the most powerful divinities intact. None truly know what happened to these gods, and accounts differ vastly... Were they slain, leaving these empty prayers to be answered at the whim of the few divinities that remain? Did they merge with those gods who sympathised with their cause, rather than vanishing into nothingness? Do the Gods that remain send avatars in their stead, to aid their followers or simply to ensnare their prayers and expand their portfolios? Whatever the case, prayers are still sometimes offered in the name of these racial gods, to those divinities that now stand in their place.
