%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History - %^BLUE%^Akadi is a member of the four ancient Elemental Lords whom have been worshipped in the realms for as long as memory serves.  Akadi's rivalry with Grumbar is famous and according to Akadian lore stems from the eternal weathering of the mountains by the winds of Akadi.  Sometime before the Godswar, Akadi subsumed worship of the minor Aesatri demigod Valkur, patron of sailors.  Sailors of Aesatri extraction in the Dagger Reaches make offerings to Akadi in the guise of Valkur, as well to Istishia, before sailing.  Akadians and Istishians in Torm enjoy a close relationship due to the importance of calm seas and favorable winds to sea travel.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Day to Day Activities - %^BLUE%^The church of Akadi is organized into small sects that follow the Whisper (working behind the scenes), or the Roar (working openly). Listening to the wind, traveling beneath the stars, pursuing personal interests of the moment, and speaking to others of the glory of Akadi dominates most priests' lives. Some priests become almost obsessively involved  in "life experiments" of a practical or esoteric nature. Yet, once a project is no longer fun or interesting, Akadians move on to something else.  
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Akadians along the coast, especially in and around Torm, typically revere the ancient aspect of Akadi known as Valkur.  Those within the Valkuryte sect typically spend their days onboard sailing ships or administering to the needs of sailors in port.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead - %^BLUE%^Akadi's faith is one about free will.  Thus she leaves it up to the personal conviction of each person to choose how they will deal with undead.  Those who are good and most neutral priests dislike them, while those with darker souls might find them useful.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BLUE%^ Novice Akadians are referred to as Fledglings.  When they become a full priest the titles are in ascending order, Winged One, Air of the Goddess, Breeze of Light, Zephyr, Mistral, Sirocco, and Whirlwind.  A priest who has slain or soundly defeated an enemy of the church may add the honorific "High" to the beginning of his or her title.
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Within the Queen of the Air's faith, there is a rather large number of rangers.  These woodland warriors are committed to Akadi's message of freedom, often to the point of working against slavers in the wilds.  They can often be found caring and watching over avians.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments - %^BLUE%^Priest of Akadi dress for rituals in robes of white, light gray, and light blue, representing the many faces of their goddess.  Silk is a preferred material in vestments, as its flowing nature pleases the goddess, and rare silks dyed in flowing or rippling patterns of blue or white are highly prized.  When adventuring or on the road the priests of Akadi dress practical, though they favor clothes or accessories of white, light gray, or light blue.
