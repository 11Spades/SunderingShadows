%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Day to Day Actives - %^CYAN%^Priests of Selune spend their time wandering, reaching out to the faithful and to potential worshippers of the moon goddess, since Selune can be worshipped anywhere. They make small coin by telling fortunes, because they can call on Selune for guidance and have much greater success than those who read the stars. In this way, Selune gains worshippers. Members of the Selunite priesthood are, by the Lady's command, generous with their healing. Selune's way thus makes the goddess ever more popular and keeps her clergy hardy, well-traveled, and in practical touch with the natural world.  The Moonmaiden's clergy believe that "any where the full moon shines is a place for Selune".  Her worshipers tend to be patient, accepting all with an understanding ear and a healing hand.  Clerics of Selune value self-reliance, humility, and practical applications of common sense far more than rigid adherence to stogy ceremonies.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Regards to Undead - %^CYAN%^Selunites abhor undead almost as much as the Lathanderites, and seek to destroy them when possible.  They encounter undead often with their battles against the forces of Shar that no Selunite would ever create or use undead.  Such a practice is the work of Shar, and not part of the doctrine that Selune teaches her followers. 

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^CYAN%^ Selunite priests use a wide variety of titles, but novices are known as the Called.  Typical Selunite titles are (in ascending order): Touched, Enstarred, Moonbathed, Silverbrow, Lunar, Initiate, and High Initiate.  All of these titles are followed by "Priestess/Priest".
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Swords of the Lady is small order inside the faith made up of cavaliers and holy knights dedicated to leading Selune's forces in battle, and questing in her name.  Paladins of Selune value compassion as much as courage, and spend much time helping common folk.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Within the Moonmaiden's faith there is a collective group of rangers.  These warriors of nature tend to operate at night, protecting the innocent from those that strike in darkness.  Learning to navigate by the stars, these rangers are rarely ever lost.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Vestments - %^CYAN%^The ceremonial costume of Selunites varies from place to place.  Selunite clergy members wear everything from plain brown robes to only a little moonstone jewelry as an accent to normal clothing to rich bejeweled gown of the finest make and haughtiest of fashion.  In the field, the followers of Selune, dress practically for the task they are undertaking.  They tend to dress fashionably, but not gaudily, in day-to-day life.%^RESET%^
