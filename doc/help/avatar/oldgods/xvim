The Cruel Master knew fear for the first time on the 2nd of Autumnstime in the year SG 662. With an ancient god's return to the lands, Xvim knew the inevitable was to come.  The Lord of Darkness, Bane, struck out at the supposed lord of tyranny, and the battle, they say, light up the pitch black sky with green lighting.   Xvim, though, was no match for the elder god and was quickly crushed and his divine essence absorbed.  When Bane announced his return to the gods and mortals, they say he threw the husk of Xvim down from the heavens and onto the Cruel Master's temple in Tonovi, crumbling it to ruins.
