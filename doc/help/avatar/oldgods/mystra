%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Day to Day Actives - %^BLUE%^Mystran clergy work hard to preserve all magical lore in secret libraries, private safe holds, well-guarded research laboratories, and small, hidden stashes so that magic flourishes in the future regardless of what befalls the thinking races of Shadowgate or the powers of the planes.  Mystrans also search out being skilled in spell use, seeking to keep watch on the identities, powers, and behavior of individuals likely to become magic-wielders of importance.  The clergy actively seek out sources of old magic, often from tombs and dangerous ruins.  They consider it more crucial to know the precise location of artifacts and items of magical power than to posses them, but wherever possible, they work to wrest control of such things from aggressively evil, the irresponsible, and the unsound of mind.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^BLUE%^While all magic is sacred, nearly all followers of Mystra are very uncomfortable with the idea of creating undead.  Those few that would use undead try to keep it a secret from the rest of the faith, due to the harsh lectures they would receive.  Still the use of undead is rare in the faith, as more often than not liches are a source of problems for the followers of Mystra.  Those followers of good and almost all neutral ethos would never willingly create undead or use them.  Some necromancers, though, do exist in very small numbers in the faith who create undead, to better learn about the magics used in the process and to aid the faith in destroying undead they encounter.  These necromancers, appointed by the church, are the only ones in the faith who are an exception to the faiths dislike of the undead.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BLUE%^ Priests of Mystra are known as Servants of Mysteries.  High level priests are called Lord/Lady of Mystery.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Knights of the Mystic Fire is an order inside the faith of Mystra composed of cavaliers and holy knight.  This invitation only prestigious order works across the lands to stem the ways of out of control mages who misuse magic, as well as the enemies of the faith.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^BLUE%^The ceremonial garb of Mystran priests is simple blue robes that are sometimes trimmed with white.  They are accented by a cloak of deep blue in colder climates.  Some form of headgear is required, though this may range from a simple blue skullcap for the scholarly orders of the north to wide, ornate, blue hats and helms in southern lands.  In the field, followers of Mystra are free to dress in the fashions of the land they inhabit, though some usually work in blue or white accessories in the form of jewelry, scarves, or sashes.%^RESET%^
