%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Day to Day Actives - %^RESET%^%^RED%^ The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, following one's heart to one's true destination, and that beauty is more than skin deep, it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's fair (or foul) face to the world. Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all part of the teachings of Sune. 
%^RED%^Sune's clerics are flighty and somewhat vain, given to dancing and wild celebrations. The hierarchy is loosely organized, and clerics are free to join or leave a temple's ranks as they wish. They preside over marriage and rites of passage ceremonies for the young, although they are not required to marry, for Sune's concern is love, not necessarily marriage. Members of Sune's clergy spend their days cultivating beauty and love in all their myriad forms. Many of Lady Firehair's clerics tend fine gardens, while others amass personal or temple-based collections of gems, crystal sculptures, and other fine works of art. While things of gold and ivory, particularly jewelry and statues, are favored, beautiful art in any form is admired, collected, and displayed.  
%^RED%^Sune's clergy sponsor artists, build friendships and romances with themselves and among others, and destroy those who vandalize things of beauty.  They are also defenders of love, working against those who try to sour or ruin relationships.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Regards to Undead -%^RESET%^%^RED%^Sune Firehair abhors undead, seeing the creation of undead as a disgusting act.  None of her clergy would ever create or summon something as ugly and foul as an undead.  Her followers destroy all undead they encounter.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^%^RED%^ The Sunite church's organization is loose and informal.  Thus there are no set title given to the priests of the faith, other than the titles Brother and Sister.  Instead some priests create their own titles. 
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The church has a small affiliated knightly order called the The Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose.  Members in this order are given to writing essays, poems, and songs of courtly love when not engaged in vital business.  Paladins of Lady Firehair defend things of beauty.  They seek out and destroy creatures that are particularly hideous in their evil.  They tend to be incredibly self-confident and are particularly effective at destroying undead.  

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^RED%^The standard ceremonial and official garb of Sune priests are monastic robes for men, habits for women, both cut to show off the figure and dyed a deep crimson. Men wear a crimson bandanna, or their hair tied back with a crimson silk scarf, while women wear a red wimple with a v-shaped forehead piece. Hair is normally worn long, and while red hair is considered touched by the goddess, all shades of hair and skin are welcome.  When not in ceremonial garb, the clergy of Sune dress as they wish, but always striving to present themselves in the best possible ways.
