%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^History - %^WHITE%^An ancient deity that was originally a member of the Aesatri pantheon in the frozen North.  The ancient Aesatri worshipped Auril to placate her wrath during the harsh winters.  Auril also earned the emnity of Aesatri by opposing the efforts of the mortal son of Tempus, Uthgar, whom was a legendary hero among the Aesatri, and their descendants in the modern Dagger Reaches.
%^BOLD%^Auril is typically used as the personification of winter in song and literature in the northern realms, but to less of a degree within the Tsarven Empire due to its milder winters and differing cultural history.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Day to Day Activities - %^WHITE%^Clergy of Auril seek to make all folk fear their goddess and her clergy (to cut down on the attacks they face) through the fury of the winter weather.  They also try to make themselves personally wealthy and influential by carrying out tasks that others cannot in the worst winter weather conditions.  Clergy members make offerings to the goddess of some of the wealth they amass.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^In the cold months Auril expects each of her priests to force or persuade someone to pray to her in the approved manner by beseeching Auril for mercy and praising her for the "cold cleansing" that she brings.  During the winter, Aurilian clergy are also expected to slay at least one creature by cold.  This is often done so as to provide worshipers or potential worshipers of the goddess with food or to slay a personal foe.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Regards to Undead - %^WHITE%^Auril's faith often makes use of the undead, just as their goddess does.  They see nothing wrong with the practice.  In fact they almost seem to prefer using corpses of those that have been slain by the cold, natural or magical.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^WHITE%^ Most priests of Auril use the honorific title "Hand of Auril" or "Icebreath", but some sects use more formal titles.  In ascending order, these are: Postulant, Votre, Icewind, Storm Sister/Brother, Frosttouch, Lady/Lord of Cold, Lady/Lord Deep Winter, Lady/Lord Cold Circle, and High Hand of Ice.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^The Shards of Ice is the military order within Auril's faith made up of cavaliers and holy knights.  The Shards of Ice serve as guards for holy sites to Auril, as well as leading the military force in battle with the foes of Auril.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Within the Frostmaiden's faith, there are a collective group of rangers.  These warriors of nature are often found in larger numbers in arctic lands.  They hire themselves out for stiff fees, serving as guides through the snow and ice.  They are often cruel, cold, and brutal when they strike. 

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Vestments - %^WHITE%^Priests of Auril wear ice-white ceremonial robes with blue piping.  The robes are cinched at the waist by a very wide silver belt.  A silver circlet on the head is the final touch for formal rituals and gatherings.  When adventuring most priests of Auril wear at least the circlet and belt with their normal day-to-day actives.
