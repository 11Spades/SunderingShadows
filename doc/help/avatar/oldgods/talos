%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Day to Day Actives - %^BLACK%^Talos always has too few worshipers for his liking, so his clergy are sent out into the world to spread word of his might and to try to recruit others to his worship - either out of fear or because such people enjoy the wielding of raw power.  As example to all, the fatalistic clerics of Talos tend to indulge in acts of random or spiteful destruction as they travel and to make examples of all folk who stand up to them or try to prevent them from entering a community or passing along a road.  Some clerics pillage, burn, and steal as enthusiastically as any brigand, and hamlets that fight them off tend to be visited a season or so later by a gathering of Talassan cleric who try to slaughter everyone and lay waste to the place.  Talos does not seem to mind clerics who indulge in fulfilling personal desires for wealth, food, luxury items, and wanton behavior as long as they call up a storm or engage in random, spectacular acts of violence once every week or so.  As a result, some clergy have taken up a life of brigandry.  They pose as lunatics in order to spread the word of Talos as ordered, and the rest of the time they adopt disguises to scout out rich prizes.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Talassan followers make regular use of undead as a way to spread destruction and sow the seeds of chaos. 

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ Typical titles used by the Talassan clergy are as followed (in ascending order): Storm Supplicant, Weatherwise, Talon , Lady/Lord of Fury, Eye of the Storm, Reaver, Stormherald, High Stormherald, and Weathermaster/Weathermistress.
%^YELLOW%^Some rangers are drawn to the faith of the Raging One.  They seek to demonstrate the destructive and violent side of nature.  They are often wild, and violent, people, given into battle at the slightest insult.  They can usually be found in places of frequent violent storms.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The clergy of Talos dress in robes and cloaks of black shot through with teardrops and jagged lines of gold or silver - garb which has earned them the unflattering name "doom crows".  The robes have jagged hems and rough, uneven sleeves.  A black eye patch is also worn, even if the clergy member has good vision in both eyes.  When not involved in ceremonies, Talassans tend to go to one of two extremes.  Either they armor themselves to the hilt in the most menacing looking armor they can obtain, or they wear next to no armor and use protective magics instead so that to average observers they look almost suicidal in their fervor to get into the thick of destruction.
