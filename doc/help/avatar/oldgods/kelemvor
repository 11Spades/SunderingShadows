%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^History - %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Kelemvor is one of only two known mortals to have personally slayed a god, with Kelemvor's victim being the former God of the Dead, Myrkul, during the Godswar.  At the end of the conflict, Kelemvor ascended to immortality and become the current Lord of the Dead, instituting a drastic change in terms of how death and the dead were handled.  Instead of being a manifestation of the fear of death to the realms, Kelemvor made a concerted effort to prepare people for their transition into the next stage of existence.  
%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Kelemvorite doctrine maintains that Kelemvor is served by an immortal advisor named Jergal, whom some sages claim once held the title God of the Death at the dawn of human civilization.  Many popular legends abound that Kelemvor and the mortal that replaced Mystra during the Godswar, were once lovers in Asgard during their youth.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Priests of Kelemvor comfort the dying and provide burials for those who die alone. They administer last rites to the dying and help the living left behind to better understand the natural and inevitable process of death and dying. When plagues, hordes, or great monsters run amok, they must be fought by the death clergy, for it is not right that many die before their due time. When marauding dragons or other monstrous predators become problems, the death clergy should try to interest adventuring bands in slaying the problems - failing that, they must deal with the problems themselves.  In cases of great pain, ravaging disease, or mutilation where death would be a mercy, it is the office of the priests of Kelemvor - and only the priests of Kelemvor - to bring death, as swiftly and painlessly as possible.  Undeath is an affront to Kelemvor. Undead creatures are to be destroyed or given true death whenever they are met with, and even sought out and hunted down for that purpose.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Regards to Undead - %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^The faith of Kelemvor are the bane of undead, seeking them out to end their unnatural lives.  The faith of Kelemvor would never use or create undead in any manner, as that would be a cardinal sin. 

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ The faith of Kelemvor does not practice the use of giving titles to priests.  The title Brother or Sister is used for all priests.  The scales on Kelemvor's symbol helps to identify rank.  Iron colored for lower clergy, silver for full priests, and golden for high-ranking priests.
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Knights of the Eternal Order are a small band of cavaliers and holy knight dedicated to Kelemvor.  The knights work to lead forces against the undead and the necromancers that create them, as well as questing across the lands in the name of Kelemvor.  The Holy Knights of the Lord of the Dead devote themselves to hunting and killing undead.
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Kelemvor has an order of rangers devoted to him.  The rangers are committed to hunting down and killing undead, and those who would create them.  They serve as well as the Lord of Death's representives in the natural world.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Cleric of Kelemvor usually wear smoky gray robes and cowled cloaks.  A silver headband is worn by all priests, which they never remove to help identify them to those in need of their services.  Their somber, yet elegant, robes bear the symbol of Kelemvor on the chests.  Their robes are always of a single hue without trim or ostentatious and of dark muted hues of green, blue, or gray and worn over armor if need be.  Adventuring clergy members dress functionally, wearing whatever armor and clothing is practical.  They are required to display the symbol of their deity prominently.  Often it is worn on the left breast over the heart or is woven into a cloak.%^RESET%^
