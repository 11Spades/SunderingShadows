%^CYAN%^Day to Day Actives - %^MAGENTA%^ Priests of Shaundakul are expected to provide for themselves by living off the land, hiring themselves out as scouts and caravan guards.  Many serve as guides for adventuring companies or as explorers.  All seek to visit the scattered shrines of Shaundakul as frequently as possible and to construct new ones when they acquire sufficient resources.   

%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead -%^MAGENTA%^Shaundakul has a strong distaste for undead, seeing them as dangers to the travelers and traders he watches over.  Followers of Shaundakul would not summon or create undead, in fact many of them work to clear out infested areas of undead to allow safe passage by others.

%^CYAN%^Titles Given to Priests -%^MAGENTA%^Priests of Shaundakul use a variety of self-chosen appellations, but a loose hierarchy of standard titles does exist.  In ascending order of rank those include: Seeker of the Wind, Scout, Trailblazer, Explorer, Guide of the Hidden Ways, Rider of the West Wind, Rider of the South Wind, Rider of the East Wind, Rider of the North Wind, and Lord High Windhand.
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Rangers heavily populate the faith of the Rider of the Winds.  They hire themselves out as guides and scouts for travelling caravans.  They teach others how to live off of the bounties of nature, while trying to instill a wanderlust in others.  They are some of the most well traveled of all rangers.%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^Vestments - %^MAGENTA%^The Shaundakun has a straightforward ceremonial raiment.  All priests sport a dark swirling cloak over garb appropriate for the trail.  They wear a leather or chain gauntlet stained deep purple or tinted black on their primary hand (and sometimes on their off hand as well).  The symbol of Shaundakul is depicted on the palm and back of the gauntlet.  The adventuring garb of Shaundakul's priests is not noticeably different than their ceremonial vestments.  His priesthood typically favors leather armor, but sometimes wears studded leather armor or chain mail.  They always wear dark, swirling cloaks and the gauntlet of their faith.
