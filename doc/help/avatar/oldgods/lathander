%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^History - %^YELLOW%^The history of Lathander is inextricably linked to the history of the ancient Kingdom of Kinnesaruda on Attaya.  Prior to its fall, the kingdom was an example of the best that humanity had to offer to the realms, and was bound together in its universal devotion to the Morninglord.  During the Godswar the combined armies of the Kinnesaruda composed most of the host of Lathander upon the fields of battle.  After the Kinnesarudan Civil War and the creation of Intruder by the power of Autarkis, many of the temples and shrines to Lathander on Attaya were overrun and repurposed by the undead, with the foul Temple of the Black Dawn being one of the most famous of these.  The Attayan refugees that settled in Sindh in the Tsarven Empire brought with them their strong faith of Lathander, causing its church to be one of the most dominant in the kingdom.  Although fiercely loyal to their adopted homeland and Emperor, many descendants of the Attayan refugees long for the day when a jihad will destroy the undead and bring renewal to Lathander's favored isle.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^%^Day to Day Activities - %^YELLOW%^%^Lathanderites seek to build anew, encouraging the rebirth of barren areas and more productive growth in cultivated lands, drive out evil, and either restore civilization to height it once had or lead it to new dizzying heights of interracial harmony, cooperation, and pursuit of the arts and progress. To do this, they battle monsters to nurture civilization; they plant seeds and new seedlings, they encourage and aid adventurers, travelers, traders, and pilgrims as the harbingers of culture. Temples of Lathander provide aid to adventurers and communities in the area so long as such aid is returned in good faith. Priests of Lathander try tirelessly to encourage those of good alignments to the more dedicated worship of the Morninglord if they are not already Lathanderites, but they do not insist on conversions or withhold aid if they are refused. 
%^YELLOW%^Clerics of Lathander tend to be ebullient utopists, "morning people" in every sense of the phrase.  They encourage social, cultural, and political progress as agents of personal liberty, artistic expression, and racial harmony(though drow, orcs, goblinoids, and other similar creatures are not included in this harmony).  Lathander's clerics sponsor athletic and artistic competitions to showcase the talents of the community, and they often finance the recovery of lost treasures or important symbols to give people hope and encourage further good works.  The tenants of Lathanderism urge respect towards one's fellows and the natural world, and intolerance for evil or those who unwillingly aid evil through slothful inaction.  Militant followers stand at the vanguard of efforts to clear civilized lands of harmful beasts or purge the taint of undead from the world.  

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Regards to Undead - %^YELLOW%^As the God of dawn, the sun, and birth Lathander abhors undead and teaches his followers to strike swiftly to destroy any undead they encounter.  The creation or use of undead within the church would be a cardinal sin, often bringing about the anger of Lathander swiftly. 

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Titles Given to Priests -%^YELLOW%^ Novice in the Lathanderian faith are called Awakened, and the gain the title of Dawnbringer upon becoming a full priest.  In ascending order of rank, the titles in general used by the Dawnbringers are: Dawngreeter, Dawnlord(the church does not use feminine form of titles often), High Dawnlord, Dawnmaster, Morninglord, High Morninglord, Morn master, High Mornmaster, and Sunrise Lord.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Order of the Aster is the most popular knightly order in the faith, and most famous in the lands.  Cavaliers and holy knights of Lathander in this order serve as the military force of the faith, as well as questing across the lands for the honor and glory of Lathander.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Morninglord's faith is rather popular with rangers.  The woodland warriors often serve as midwives, helping animal's with difficult births.  As they travel the natural world, they plant seeds to encourage growth.  Practicing self-perfection and displays of athletics, the rangers of Lathander are some of the most hardy and well-toned.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Vestments - %^YELLOW%^Priests of Lathander dress in bright long-sleeved robes of yellow, red, and pink.  These are often called "sun robes".  A sunburst headpiece, worn towards the back of the head to emulate a rising sun or a radiant sunpeacock, completes the ceremonial garb.  Adventuring clerics usually wear more utilitarian garb, but prefer reds and yellows, to the point of tinting their armor those shades.
