%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^History - %^GREEN%^Bane has only recently returned to the realms after an absence of over 650 years.  Bane was a Greater Power prior to the Godswar which saw his apparent destruction at the hands of Tyr and Torm.  In the wake of the Godswar, Bane's feckless son, Iyachtu Xvim, took up the mantle of Bane while trying to fend off Cyric's perpetual encroachments on his portfolio.  In the second century SG, Xvim slew the minor divinity Hoar, adding revenge and retribution to his portfolio, which was eventually transferred to Bane upon his resurrection.
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Xvim was destroyed by the resurrection of Bane, which is rumored to have been aided by the efforts of the archmage Stefano Esposair, at midnight on 2 Autumnstime, 662 SG, which is now a holy day within the faith.  The transfer of worship from Xvim to Bane was relatively bloodless and happened without incident within Tonovi and Phaederia.  Bane is slowly regaining his former glory and power and presumably will regain Greater Power status during the eighth century SG.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Day to Day Activities - %^GREEN%^Bane orders his clerics and followers to achieve positions of power within their society, either through force or trickery, and to use that power to further the cause of hate, fear, and strife.  The Black Hand much prefers his clerics to subvert governments and carry out their agendas under cover of the rule of law, but he tolerates a limited amount of discord and debauchery.  Torture, beatings, and calculated assassinations frequently come into play in such operations, and rare indeed is the initiate of the Lord of Darkness who does not possess at least rudimentary skills in such enterprises.   The church operates under a strict hierarchy - questioning or disobeying the orders of a superior is an insult to Bane's supremacy, and is punishable by torture, disfigurement, or death.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Regards to Undead - %^GREEN%^The faith of Bane makes regular use of undead, either provided by the clergy or the wizards that follow The Tyrant Lord.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Titles Given to Priests -%^GREEN%^ The titles used within the faith of Bane fall in a strict order.  In descending order they are: Deep Mystery, Dread Tyrant, Dark Doom, Masked Death, Vigilant Talon, Striking Hand, Black Fang, Hooded Menace, Deadly Adept, Willing Whip, Watchful Brother/Sister, Trusted Servant, Servant, Slave, Wretched Slave.  The titles Brother/Sister Faithful and Dread Sister/Brother are sometimes used in place of the strict titles given to them. 
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^The Knights of the Black Gauntlet are the military order of cavaliers and holy knights dedicated to Bane.  The Knights work as guards for holy sites of Bane, as well as leading the armies of the numerous military campaigns the church of Bane undertakes.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Vestments - %^GREEN%^Banite clergy members always are armed and required to wear something black.  Ceremonial dress of Banite priests is black armor with a blood-red cape.  The more prosperous the priest, the finer the workmanship of the armor was.  The ceremonial robes of wizards of the clergy are always black, with members of the highest ranks enspelled these robes to swirl with ever-present illusions of glittering black stars and splashes of spilling blood.  Facial tattoos are common among Banites.  When adventuring priests of Bane retain their black armor, though their battle armor usually sported cruel spurs, hooks, and horns.  Wizardly clergy members preferred long, flowing, black and red robes.%^RESET%^
