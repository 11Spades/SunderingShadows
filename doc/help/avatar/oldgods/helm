%^BLUE%^History - %^CYAN%^The popularity of Helm's faith has been on the decline over the last couple centuries.  Some scholars link his decline to the rise in popularity of Torm throughout the realms, especially among the peasantry and the bourgeosis, whom feel that Helm is not particularly sympathetic to their interests.  This has caused a rivalry of sorts to develop between the faithful of Helm and Torm.  In an effort to prove Helm's detractors wrong, the clergy of Helm has tried to make concerted efforts to reach out and help those in need, with the events surrounding the redemption of Ignatius and the founding of New Antioch being a prime example.  Despite these efforts, Helm's success compared to Torm have been few and far between.

%^BLUE%^Day to Day Activities - %^CYAN%^Helmite clergy believe they can win back the rightful power of Helm only through demonstrated excellence of vigilance and purity of loyalty in their roles as guardians and protectors. They have set about trying to train bodyguards everywhere and spreading the word that only Helm-tested worshipers of the God of Guardians are truly worthy and reliable to their masters.

%^BLUE%^Regards to Undead - %^CYAN%^The faith of Helm views the use of undead as a coward's way to fight.  Many of the faithful in turn seek out to destroy nests and cells of undead that prey upon villages or towns.

%^BLUE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^CYAN%^ Titles used by the church of Helm are, in ascending order of rank: Novice, Adept, Trusty, Alert, Watchknight, Guardian, Overblade, High Watcher and Senior Steeleye.
%^RED%^The Vigilant Eyes of the God is an order of cavaliers and paladins within the church of Helm who serves as private guards to Senior Steeleyes and lead the military force of Helm out in battle.  Paladins of the Watcher tend to prefer to guard against evil or slay it outright rather than work to heal its damages.  They seem rigid and uninterested in helping others.

%^BLUE%^Vestments - %^CYAN%^Priests of Helm wear spotless, shining, unblemished full plate armor with open-faced helms (a visor reduces vision and only Helm is granted the honor of wearing a visored helmet).  Often helms are topped with plumes.  Such armor may be accessorized with red cloaks and steel gray tabards, and such garments - or the armor - may be adorned with the Unsleeping Eye in the center of both the back and breast.  In southern regions, Helmite clergy members often wear the finest full plate armor set with gems and worked with gold filigree in designs that accentuate great golden eyes set in the center of their chests (on the breastplate) and backs.  In areas where heavily armored clerics are frowned on, the armor is reduced to a set of heavy shoulder plates but the helm remains in any case.  When adventuring the clergy of Helm use their ceremonial gear due to its usefulness. Unless it is decorated with such costly materials that the priest fears it will attract thieves and adopt more utilitarian suits of armor.  In either case, the armor is dominated by the symbol of Helm's eye on the chest, often shown in a sunburst or as the topmost level of a stepped pyramid. %^RESET%^
