%^ORANGE%^Day to Day Actives - %^RED%^Priests of the war god are charged to keep warfare a thing of rules, respected reputation, and professional behavior, minimizing uncontrolled bloodshed and working to eradicate feuding that extends beyond a single dispute or set of foes. Warriors - especially mercenaries - who employ poison or taint well, sow fields with salt, kill noncombatants, indulge in torture or the random slaughter of innocents when they are not at war, or commit similar sins against fair battle are to be denied the favor of the god, their crimes are to be publicized far and wide, and they are to be made to atone for their deeds or perish.

%^ORANGE%^Regards to Undead - %^RED%^Tempus views war and battle as something among the living.  The Tempites hold a deep regard for the dead, honoring their memories and retelling stories of famous warriors who died in battle.  For this reason the use of undead and creation is a practice not performed in Tempus' faith. 

%^ORANGE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RED%^ Military ranks within the faith are common.  Ranks typical of many temples of Tempus are Warpriest, Swung Sword, Terrible Sword, Lance of the Lord, Shield of the God, Battlelady/Battlelord, Swordmaster/Swordmistress, and Lady/Lord of the Field.
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^A few rangers join the Foehammer's faith.  More often than not, they serve as scouts for military campaigns.  They believe that nature can be just as war-like and violent as the rest of the world.%^RESET%^

%^ORANGE%^Vestments - %^RED%^When not in battered armor, the clergy of the war god wear helms or steel skullcaps, though they are careful never to cover their faces, for such a close emulation of Tempus is thought to be an affront to the Lord of Battles.  Some of the fanatical wandering priests never remove all of their armor at any time.  The robes of a priest of Tempus always sport trim in the crimson hue of fresh blood, but vary in overall color.  Darker colored robes are worn by those of lower ranks.  Most war priests wear ceremonial garments in brown or wine purple.  Red or amber is worn by senior clergy, and yellow or white by those of the most exalted rank.  When adventuring, most wear the best armor they can obtain, though it is battle-worn and battered as it is for use, not show.  A full helm is usual, but it is worn either with an open face plate or no face plate.%^RESET%^
