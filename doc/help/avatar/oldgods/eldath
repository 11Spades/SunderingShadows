Eldath's fading, many sages speculate, was the herald of the New Age to come.  Over the past centuries, the Lady of Peace's faith had grown smaller and smaller - leaving her with only a handful of faithful these past few decades.  The sages go on to ponder if Eldath's appearance in the lands was tied to the fact that her divinity was fading and her power growing weaker.  There was one god, though, who was pleased to see a weakened Goddess of Peace in the lands - Malar.  The animosity between the churches of Mielikki, Eldath, and Silvanus against the church of Malar is one that is older than the elves themselves, some say older than even the dragons.  Malar, seeking to gain a upper hand in this turmoil, hunted and stalked Eldath throughout the lands.  He waited with a patience uncommon in the Beastlord until the moment was right to strike.  Eldath did manage to fend of his attack and get away, but not without being severely wounded.  She arrived at the Temple of Mielikki looking for the aid of her divine sister.  It was there, some whisper, that Istishia came to her and offered her a chance to live on, instead of fading from the lands.  Eldath was hesitant at first, but agreed.  The two joined together  thus creating a feminine version of Istishia - The Lady of Singing Waters.
