%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^History - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Beshaba is one of a group of deities to recently return to the realms after over six centuries of absence.  Beshaba disappeared during the Godswar and was assumed to be one of the conflict's many godly casualties.  In fact, Beshaba was imprisoned along with Sune and Shaundakul by Talos during the Godswar, for reasons only known to him.  Even in the past, Beshaba's faith was among the smallest in the realms, being feared more than worshipped.  With her recent return she has been downgraded to Demipower status and will probably languish there for some time due to her general unpopularity.  In the past few decades since her return, Beshaba has quietly adopted the forgotten portfolios of a couple of long dead divinities, namely those of poison, disease, and decay, in an effort to expand her worship in the realms.
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Within the faiths of Beshaba and Tymora there is a small cult that claims the two deities were once a single deity in ancient times.  Those that publicly preach this heresy within Beshaba's faith are met with a quick demise, whereas they are quietly rehabilitated when found within Tymora's faith.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Beshaba is worshipped largely out of fear, and it is the task of her clergy to spread that fear.  The clergy works in a variety of ways, by starting talk of Beshaba's power and latest wickedness, by instructing all in how to make offerings to her, or in how to join her clergy if they would prefer to be protected against all misfortune.  Along the ways, the members of her priesthood take care to indulge their tastes for random cruelty and sadism.  They enjoy acting mysteriously to manipulate simpler folk into serving them in matters both great and small, from providing them with food, luxurious shelter, and companionship to giving them weapons to wield against their rivals in the church of Beshaba.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Regards to Undead -%^RESET%^%^RED%^Followers of Beshaba make regular use of undead, seeing them as tools and agents of spreading misfortune to the lands.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^%^RED%^In ascending order of rank, the titles in general use by the church of Beshaba are: Bewildered (novices), the Unfortunate, Finger of Fear, Hand of Strife, Higher Hand of Strife, Hand of Gloom, Higher Hand of Gloom, Hand of Horror, Higher Hand of Horror, Hand of Despair, Higher Hand of Despair, Mistress/Master of Dread, and Nails of the Lady.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Female priest of Beshaba wear robes of mauve, red, and black, and are usually branded or tattooed on one instep with Beshaba's Badge (the antlers) and on one thigh with rows of marks or rank which can only be read by fellow initiates.  These are covered by normal clothing when the priestess is outside the temple.  Male priests wear robes of crimson and are usually tattooed with Beshaba's Badge on one cheek.  Some find they prefer more simpler garb and wear black stocking and tunics with the symbol of Beshaba on the chest.  When working in the field, under cover, or simply traveling, most Beshaban clergy wear utilitarian garb appropriate to their locale and the level of danger they anticipate encountering.%^RESET%^
