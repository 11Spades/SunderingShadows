%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Day to Day Actives - %^WHITE%^Clerics of Tymora favor gaiety and spontaneity, believing that those who enjoy the greater fortune are those who take the greatest risks.  The clergy go through the lands urging folk to take chances and pursue their dreams, and to not spend all their days planning and daring nothing. They do not, as some folk say, encourage folk to indulge in reckless whims and frivolity.  The position their temples as refueling stops for adventuring bands, often offering such staples as holy water and healing.  Some churches take this a step furthers, offering excessive secret aid to the most daring of adventures in a public relations effort to "prove" the value of Tymora's doctrine.  Clerics hail the miraculous successes of these heroes upon their return from dangerous dungeons and haunted tombs, declaring their survival and plunder the reward of Lady Luck.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Regards to Undead - %^WHITE%^Tymora restricts the use of undead among her followers, for the undead are servants, messengers, and tools of Beshaba and her misfortune.  For a follower of Tymora to use or create undead it is seen as inviting the misfortunes of Beshaba into their life. 

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^WHITE%^Among the followers of Tymora titles are used and change with ease and informality, but "Lord Priest" and "Lady Priestess" are respectful forms of address that apply to all, and "High" is added in front of this for clergy senior in years or in demonstrated powers.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Vestments - %^WHITE%^The standard clerical dress varies from priest to priest.  Some favor full habits and headpieces while others like simple robes.  Blue and silver are colors often seen.  Personal taste of the dress code, climate, and availability of cloth determines what a Tymoran will dress in.  All adventuring or traveling clergy members wear whatever garments they please, though the colors blue and silver are still predominant.  High boots also seem a favorite fashion element. %^RESET%^
