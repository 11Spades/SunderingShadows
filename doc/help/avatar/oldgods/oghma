%^MAGENTA%^Day to Day Actives - %^YELLOW%^Clerics of Oghma are known as Namers.  The church welcomes members of all races and various philosophies, provided prospective clerics swear to the doctrine of the Binder of What is Known and dedicate themselves to acquiring, administering and protecting knowledge.  Those of the church might remain cloistered in temples (usually academics or sages more at home among scrolls and books than among their fellows) or travel the land, recording their experiences and periodically reporting to the temples they encounter on their travels.  Wayfaring clerics and bards within the church tend to be adventuresome and curious, bon vivants who occasionally come into ideological conflict with their academic counterparts.  The two branches need each other, however, and such reprobation seldom escalates beyond mild disapproval. 

%^MAGENTA%^Regards to Undead - %^YELLOW%^The faith of Oghma is rather neutral in its use of undead.  Those followers of good and nearly all neutral ethos would never create or use undead, as the practice is seen as an evil act.  Though there are some who are curious by the undead and create them as a way to learn more about how they work, and help battle them better.  A very rare few actually use undead, but they almost always keep this a secret. 

%^MAGENTA%^Titles Given to Priests -%^YELLOW%^ Acolytes in service to Oghma are called Seekers.  When the acolyte becomes a full priest they are known as Loremasters.  As they rise in the ranks new titles are given to them, they are in ascending order: Loremaster, Loremaster Amanuensis, Loremaster Venturer, Loremaster Bold, Lorescribe of the God, Wise Anticipator, Inspirator, Inspirator High, Song of the God, Higher Song of the God, Loremaster High, Loremaster Most High, Eye of Oghma, and Divine Hand of Oghma.

%^MAGENTA%^Vestments - %^YELLOW%^All priests of Oghma have the same ceremonial dress - white shirt and trousers with a vest of black and gold brocade.  The shirt sleeves are wide, but tied at the wrists.  The vests, known as kantlara, depict many glyphs, sigils, runes and symbols of magical power, arcane meaning, and significance in various realms down through the ages.  Such markings are sewn on by the wearer using gold braid.  At any time a priest ascends a level, she or he usually sees the symbols to be sewn in a dream vision.  Kantlara are thus personal and individual garments.  A small boxlike hat is worn in ceremonies held on sacred grounds, off of a holy site the hat is removed.  In the field, Oghmanyte priests have a relaxed dress code, wearing whatever they choose.%^RESET%^
