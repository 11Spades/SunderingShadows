%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Day to Day Actives - %^GREEN%^The clergy of Mielikki are oriented towards protecting nature (especially forests) from the forces of evil and ignorance.  They often wander among small communities nestled at the edges of forests both great and small, encouraging the inhabitants to both care for and respect the trees and life beneath their leafy boughs.  They try to prevent further encroachment by civilization on the remaining great forests by teaching careful forest husbandry.  When called upon, they defend the trees with force of arms if necessary.  Rangers of the faith (the Needles) support the clerics (the Forestarms) in defending, renewing, and even extending forests and forest life.  They oppose those who deal in fire magic and encourage both city and farm dwelling folk to view woodlands as pleasant refuges for renewal and enjoying natural beauty, not deadly wilds to be feared and fought. 

%^ORANGE%^Regards to Undead - %^GREEN%^As a nature goddess, Mielikki views undead as unnatural and an insult to all life.  Thus her followers view undead as a taint on the lands and will do what they can to return them back to the arms of nature.  No follower of Mielikki would ever create or use undead, as that would be a cardinal sin against what their Goddess stands for. 

%^ORANGE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^GREEN%^ Forestarms tend to be practical, unfussy folk, reverent in their fireside prayers to the Forest Queen but impatient with too much ceremony.  Their titles reflect this: Novices are called Questers.  In ascending order the titles given are, Spring Stag(for cleric members with less than two winters of service), Stalkers of the Green (experienced clergy), Forest Flames (senior clergy and tutors of the faith), High Rangers (leaders of a temple), and Hawk of the Lady (given by Mielikki herself to a rare few).
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Of all the faiths, The Forest Queen has the largest collection of rangers.  Though it should be no surprise, as Mielikki is the patron of all rangers.  Mielikki's rangers are called the Needles of her faith, and are given to protecting and nuturing the natural world.  The Needles often come into violent clashes with rangers of Talos and Malar.%^RESET%^

%^ORANGE%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Mielikkian ceremonial garb consists of trousers, brown boots, a short cape and a tabard that is long-sleeved in winter and sleeveless in summer.  The colors of these garments vary by season, winter is white with green accents, spring green with yellow accents, summer yellow with red accents, and autumn red with white accents.  The Unicorn's Head, usually carved from bone or ivory or stitched in silver, is always worn over the heart.  When in the field , most clergy of Mielikki dress appropriate for the weather and their duties.  They try to maintain the colors of the season in their garment still, even if just as a sash or baldric.%^RESET%^
