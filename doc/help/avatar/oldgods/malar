%^BOLD%^%^RED%^History - %^RESET%^Malar is a member of the Gods of Fury and is an enemy of the encroachment of civilization upon the wilderness.  Legend speaks of his relentless attacks upon the elven pantheon during ancient times, before its destruction and merging into the current pantheon.  In recent times Malar is best remembered for his relentless pursuit of Eldath which led to her merging with Istishia.  Malar's faith among humans and half-elves is somewhat confined to the fringes of civilization, and commonly is found beyond what is even classified as 'civilized.'  

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^Priests of Malar indulge in hunting as often as possible and strive to route the hunt to make it as dangerous as possible, so that its finale takes place in a settled area (so that the Malarite can demonstrate their superiority, of course). Common folk who do not appreciate having monsters chased through town tend to hate and fear Malarite clergy members - which is the whole idea: Those who do not venerate the Lord of Beasts should respect him out of fear. Malarite clergy preach the joys and the bountiful yields of the hunt and work to thwart the expansion of farms and settlements so as to preserve as much wilderness as possible. They work against the priesthoods of Mielikki, staging raids and vandalism much as outlaws and bored young nobleman do.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^RESET%^Typically followers of Malar rather work with live creatures to spread the fear of Malar to mortals, but some find undead to be useful as well.  Given the choice though, a Malarite will almost always choose live creatures over undead ones. 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^ The church of Malar is loosely bound and without a central hierarchy.  Malarite priests are known as Lords of the Hunt or Huntlords, while followers are known as "of the Hunt".  No individual titles are used across the faith. Though some clergy members are often known by names such as Brother Stag or Sister Wolf in recognition of the most powerful beasts they have slain alone.
%^RED%^Savage and brutal rangers find favor in Malar's faith.  These woodland warriors seek to demonstrate the cruel and deadly side to nature, that often goes ignored.  Typically they cloth themselves in bloody hides, and wear fetishes made from bone, teeth, and claws.  They are some of the more fearsome and deadly of all that that up the life of the ranger.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^RESET%^Huntmasters wear headpieces made from the pelt and head of the most impressive beast they have been able to slay with their bare hands (or use of the claws of Malar), usually a bear or great cat but sometimes an owlbear, leucrotta or pertyon.  Malarites carry hunting horns at their belts and are never without at least three daggers.  Woodland garb of red or brown is favored dress for hunts.  By day, red hunt clothing is often concealed by a woolcloak of mottled black, gray, and green.  Necklaces of animal fangs, bones, and claws and a variety of pelts are often worn in addition to normal hunt clothes when the priests desire to impress.  When adventuring priests of Malar dress practically, but most favor armor constructed from the hides of living creatures that allows flexibility and rapid movement.  Necklaces of claws and fangs and a variety of pelts from predator animals are often worn to quietly demonstrate a Malarites' hunting prowess to the members of a community.%^RESET%^
