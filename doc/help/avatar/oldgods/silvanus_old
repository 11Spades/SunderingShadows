Dieties of ShadowGate:
======================

The church of Silvanus, The Oak Father
----------------------------------------------

With the dawn of a new age, many changes have 
lead Silvanus to a new direction in his divine 
stance.  With the loss of Eldath from the lands,
and with mortals' lack of reverence for nature 
and the flora and fauna, Silvanus has turned his 
back on the mortals.  He has plunged himself into 
a deeper connection with nature and taken to 
focusing on their needs rather than wasting his 
time with uncarring mortals.  Those priests of 
Silvanus who remain in the lands are the last to 
recieve his divine patronage.  All others find 
their prayers going unanswered and their want of 
devotion to him ignored.  Many feel Silvanus has 
taken the stance of "Too little, Too late" with 
the mortal world, as he sequesters himself from 
their arguments, their ambition, and their lack 
of respect for his element.
