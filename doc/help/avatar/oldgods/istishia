%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^History - %^CYAN%^Istishia is one of the of the ancient Elemental Lords, with fellow Elemental Lord Kossuth being a main rival.  Since Istishia's merging with the dying Eldath, the Water Lord has transmuted into a feminine form and has begun styling herself as The Mother of Water, or the Lady of the Singing Waters.  Much like the transmutation that the water cycles through, the faith of Istishia has accepted this new form with open arms and points to how their deity may always change, but still remain the same.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Day to Day Activities - %^CYAN%^The church of the Lady of the Waves subscribes to many philosophies.  Istishia's faith calls to a wide variety of individuals.  Some within the faith work to use water as a cleanser, washing away the impurities.  While others work closely with the sailors, seamen, and merchants who travel by sea.  They pray for calm seas and to protect both ships and ports from the Queen of the Seas's power, but they also call upon the oceans to deliver Istishia's wrath on against those who oppose the church.  Others focus on the natural world, traveling and documenting the various streams, springs, waterfalls, ponds, lakes, and rivers across the land.  Since the divine transformation, the Istishians have began to preach just as water moves from one state to another yet remains eternally present, so life moves from one stat to another yet continues.
%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^The clergy work to keep sources of water from becoming polluted.  Their temples are well-known for crafting excellent pottery.  Istishians have also began to adopt some of the natural groves around waterfalls, springs, and brooks left unattended in the wake of Eldath's fading.  Many Eldathians have been taken openly into the arms of Istishia, finding they are allowed to continue many of the practices they followed under the Green Goddess with ease.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Regards to Undead - %^CYAN%^The faith of Istishia discourages the use of undead, though Istishia herself has not shown to favor or disfavor them.  Some followers of more sinister lifestyles find a use for undead, but tend to keep this a secret from the rest of the faith.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^CYAN%^ Novice Istishians are called Searchers.  After becoming full fledged priest the titles given in ascending order are: Essential Servant, Spring of the Goddess, Tidal Messenger, Cephalian, Full Flood, Monsoon, Typhonic Oracle, Grand Oracle, Stratus Primae.  Priest who have soundly defeated or slain an enemy of the church are allowed to add the honorific "True" to the beginning of his or her title.
%^CYAN%^Within the Mother of All Water's faith there is collective group of rangers.  These wilderness warriors are more often than not found near the coast or in places where water runs free.  They work to protect those that live in the waters  from those that would pollute, despoil, or taint Istishia's domain.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Vestments - %^CYAN%^Priests of Istishia dress in blue-and-green robes with coral decorations for ceremonial  occasions.  Exact decoration and garment constructions are not mandated by the faith, but shaded or rippled dyeing, graceful embroidery or beadwork, or layered or dragged construction are often employed to convey a water theme.  When adventuring priests are free to wear whatever clothes they deem appropriate, though they are fond of wearing items in white, blue, green, and blue-purple hues.%^RESET%^
