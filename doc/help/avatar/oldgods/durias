%^RESET%^%^RED%^Day to Day Activities - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The clergy of Durias live in secrecy, biding their time until their numbers have grown strong enough to survive the attention of their many enemy faiths. Scattered throughout the realm and often hiding among the faithful of other dark divinities they perform their offerings of blood and pain nightly to their Dark Prince. Their mission is to steal converts from other dark faiths with the promise that their god will not only become a potent force among the divine but that he will also elevate his most gifted servants with divinity of their own. Promising converts are scouted for long periods and tested with all manner of terrible trials. Only after they have survived the tests are they approached and any who do not show an immediate interest in the faith are never seen again. Due to these rigorous trials, the faith grows slowly but is comprised of only the elite whose concentrated power makes the faith far stronger than its numbers might otherwise indicate. All clergy are expected to test themselves rigorously and regularly, weakness is in no way tolerated.

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Undead are considered a valuable tool by the servants of the Dark Prince and are used whenever appropriate. One of the clergy's favorite trials is to send the corpses of long dead loved ones or close friends to attack the potential convert.

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The faith is still too young to have formal titles, each sect creating its own for its priests. As the faith grows and the strongest sects absorb the smaller ones into their numbers this is likely to change. It is rumored there is a special group of the faithful referred to as Reapers whose main objective is to seek out the remaining survivors of Loviatar's faith. 

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^On the rare occasion that the clergy are able to wear their vestments openly, it tends to be quite the show. The Dark Prince expects not only power but perfection of form from his disciples and so the ceremonial garb is always made to accentuate this. Revealing and form fitting attire in shades of black and red are most common with the highest ranking priest present expected to wear only the blood of the night's sacrifice.  %^RESET%^
