%^BOLD%^%^RED%^History - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Kossuth is a member of the ancient Elemental Lords, and according to myth, taught primitive man how to harness the power of fire.  The sibiliant flames of Kossuth have long seduced the power-hungry and has caused many throughout the realms to label Kossuthans as corrupt and self-serving puppetmasters, almost in the same vein as many Banites; even leading to the ban of Kossuthans from political office in the Kingdom of Sindh in the Tsarven Empire.  A small and obscure cult is known of within the faith of Kossuth that centers upon prophecy and fate.  The cult is paid little attention to by most mainstream adherents of Kossuth, although it does provide as a source of annoyance to the hierarchy of an otherwise very organized faith.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Tending to the fires of the church and making sure they never go out is a job for the Lightless. Other members of the church of Kossuth plan ceremonies, instruct novices,  and pursue promotion, promotion, promotion. Being the leader of a temple means that a priest can finally do what he or she wants to, rather than what his or her superiors say. Most priests become addicted to the desire for power this atmosphere breeds and grow into small, power-hungry tyrants, prone to unscrupulous behavior and to overreaching their limits. Though this may not be the path Kossuth intended for his faithful, he speaks not a word against it. Most temples pursue goals of conquest, land acquisition, wealth, and rulership, making alliances with whoever is most expedient to their goals.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Regards to Undead - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Anything that would help an ambitious Kossuthan get ahead, they typically will use.  Though good and most neutral aligned followers would find some aversion to the use of undead. 

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^%^RED%^ Novice Kossuthians are referred to as the Lightless.  Upon becoming a full priest of the church they are known as the Promised.  As they move up the ranks of their faith, their titles are : Torch of the Faith, Righteous Flame, Devoted Blaze, Zealous Pyre, Pillar of Flame, Fury of the Faith, Flamebrother/Flamesister, Inspired Forge, Numinous Blaze, Most Fervid Fire and Eternal Flame of Kossuth.
%^YELLOW%^Knights of the Fire Drake is the military order of the faith made up of cavaliers and knights.  The Fire Drakes lead the faith's numerous holy campaigns, and provide personal protection to the Eternal Flames.
%^YELLOW%^Within the Firelord's faith there is a gatherine of rangers.  These warriors work to protect the fiery power of Kossuth.  They advocate forest fires as a way to cleanse the lands.  They are often as power hungry and ruthless as their counterparts.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Vestments - %^RESET%^%^RED%^Those who follow the Tyrant Among Fire dress in light robes of red, crimson, and orange.  The use of armour while participating in a ceremony in a shrine or temple is forbidden to all but the cavaliers and knights.  Embroidery depicting flames of various hues is a personal decoration to ceremonial robes, and the decorations grow more elaborate and expensive with increases in a Kossuthian's rank.  Firesilk, a rare fabric, is highly prized and fought over in the faith.  Red and crimsons are the favored colors of the faithful when adventuring, though they wear whatever clothing is appropriate in style to their current location.  Most Kossuthans are extremely fond of magical items that do loud, flashy, sudden, and brutal damage, and display them prominently in an offensive posture at the drop of a hat.%^RESET%^
