%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Day to Day Actives - %^ORANGE%^Most disturbances tended to by Silvanus' priesthod are due to too-heavy hunting or farming.  Wildlife breeding, nursing sick animals, and replanting trees and wild shrubs are all quite public activities of the priesthood, to redress the slipping Balance of nature.  More secretively, so as to maintain their image as essentially benign lovers of trees, they are also kept busy working to redirect development and control populations through covert sponsorship of brigands, breeding and selective placing of predators, and other means.  Silvanite clergy plan for the longterm, so as not to worsen any shift of the Balance, and it is held that superior patience, natural knowledge, and anticipation are the hallmarks of a worthy servant of the Oakfather.

%^GREEN%^Regards to Undead - %^ORANGE%^As undead do not stand as a part of the natural Balance, Silvanite clergy avoid their use and seek to purge them where they are found.

%^GREEN%^Titles Given to Priests -%^ORANGE%^ The clergy of the Oakfather does not maintain specific titles of rank, particularly given its nomadic and scattered nature.
%^GREEN%^Silvanus is the patron of druids, and as such they hold equal rank with priests among his clergy.  Druidic followers tend more towards the wilderness, whereas in urban areas it is more common to find his clergy as priests, tending small pockets of nature and forest within the encroaching walls of civilisation.%^RESET%^

%^GREEN%^Vestments - %^ORANGE%^Ceremonial garb for both clerics and druids is a suit of armor made of overlapping leaves, whether it be made of leather for druidic followers, or metal for clerics.  Either is worn with green breeches and shirt, topped with a large helm with oak leaf-shaped wings.  In more urban areas, a simple copper oak pin worn on the breast is considered acceptable when clergy are not involved in high ceremonies.  Adventuring garb is often far more practical, and tends towards being colored and constructed of natural materials.%^RESET%^
