%^RESET%^Day to Day Actives - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Maskarran are perhaps the wealthiest clergy in the realms.  They are able to call on untold wealth stolen in the past and hidden away in secret places.  Maskarran do not hoard and gloat over their takings like dwarves do over gold; they actively use it to buy agents, bribe officials, sway agreements, and manipulate folk to do thus and so, working behind the scenes to achieve mysterious ends.  The Maskarran typically tend to their plots from day to day and provide support to and collect tithes from individual thieves and thieves' guilds.

%^RESET%^Regards to Undead - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Mask cares not if his followers make use of undead or not, just as long as they do not go against his doctrine.  Some neutral followers of Mask though have problems working with undead, though this number tends to be small. 

%^RESET%^Titles Given to Priests -%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ Maskarran address each other as "Brother/Sister Shadow", regardless of rank and holding the titles (in order of rank): Unproven(novices), Proven Brother/Sister, Veteran Brother/Sister, Master Brother/Sister, with the leader of a temple assuming the titles Lord/Lady Master.

%^RESET%^Vestments - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Ceremonial Maskarran dress consists of tunics and trousers in a bright motley.  The tunics sport ballooned sleeves and cuffs and bright embroidery, displaying wealth.  The entire outfit is covered with a full-length, hooded gray cloak that can be drawn shut to hide the bright color beneath.  A black cloth mask is worn beneath the hood.  In some areas where Mask has fallen on particularly hard times the gray cloak and mask are worn as a symbol of the Shadowlord's favor.  Inside temples of Mask, the masks are of black gauze and do not conceal the identity of the wearer; in public such masks are usually thick, black wool or heavy, double-thick silk, and extend to cover most of the face in an effective disguise.  (A bearded priests, for example, would have a mask that extends well down over the chin.)  There is a saying that "the degree of law in a town can be seen on the face of a priest of Mask."  When adventuring priest of Mask are encouraged to hide their true nature and masquerade as other priests or commoners.  Normal dress for clerics of Mask is similar to that of any merchant, craftsperson, or adventures in the area or similar to that of any armored battle cleric of itinerant adventuring cleric of any faith.%^RESET%^
