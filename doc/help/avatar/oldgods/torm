%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Day to Day Actives - %^YELLOW%^Tormish provide training for, give sanctuary to, and lend support to guardians, orders of paladins, and loyal knights. They watch for impending trouble and for young folk who could be recruited into the service of Torm. They also speak for the oppressed, guide the lost, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, and gather herbs and make medicines at all times for disasters to come. On rare occasions they act militarily against forces of evil.  The priesthoods of Helm and Torm have been long engaged in a rivalry, and its friendliness has been waning over the years. Tormtar keep a close eye on all faithful of Helm they encounter, anticipating betrayal at any time.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Regards to Undead - %^YELLOW%^The use and creation of undead in Torm's faith is seen as a sin.  Agents of Bane and other dark gods use undead to serve their purpose, the Tormtar see themselves as far more noble than that and would never seek to use or create undead for any reason.  Like followers of Selune, Lathander and Kelemvor, the Tormtar seek to destroy undead when they are encountered. 

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^YELLOW%^Torm's faith has a strict hierarchy, much like a military order.  The hierarchy among Torm's disciples ascends from The Unproven to the Andurans, Faithblades, Wardens, Vigilants, Watchful Ventures, Loyans, Enforcers, Guardians, Knights, Vanguardiers, and Champions.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Paladins and cavaliers in Torm's faith seek the chance to become a member in The Order of the Golden Lions, the most popular and well respected order in the faith.  Paladins of the True God defend the weak, defeat evil, and uphold the high moral standard required for the servants of Torm.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Vestments - %^YELLOW%^Priests of Torm wear clean, bright, smooth-polished plate armor (or robes, a breastplate, and gauntlets) and helms.  Gauntlets are a common theme among all faithful, either for decoration or functional.  The hue of the armor (or robes) denotes the rank of the wearer: Unadorned metal is for the Unproven, dark crimson for Andurans, rose red is for Faithblades, deep amber is for Wardens, sunrise orange is for Vigilants, harvest yellow is for Watchful Ventures, pale green is for Loyans, dragon green is for Enforcers, sky blue is for Guardians, twilight blue is for Knights, amethyst is for Vanguardiers, and dusky purple is for Champions, the most holy priests of the faith as well as the greatest heroes of Torm.  In potential combat situations and in the wild, Tormtar always wear their best armor and weaponry.  They are expected to keep their armor clean and brightly polished even in the worst conditions, except where such activities would interfere with the execution of their duty.%^RESET%^
