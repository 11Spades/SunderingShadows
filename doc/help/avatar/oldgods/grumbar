%^ORANGE%^History - %^RESET%^Grumbar is a member of the Elemental Lords whom have been worshipped since the beginning of time.  Grumbar's faith has slowly evolved over time by adopting the portfolios of the ancient Tsarven god of earth and Gond, the god of artifice and craft after the Godswar; proving that even the most stubborn cannot resist the tides of change.  Only after nearly seven centuries of adopting Gond's portfolios has Grumbar finally formed a friendship of sorts with Lathander due to the importance of creativity required in crafting, however Lathander's enthusiastic nature is a slight annoyance to the Earthlord.

%^ORANGE%^Day to Day Activities - %^RESET%^The faithful of Grumbar can often be found spending their days side by side with miners digging tunnels, with prospectors panning for gold, and with blacksmiths forging new weapons and armor.  Those who are loyal to the Master of Metal are peerless miners and smiths.  They continuously hone their skill in underground environments, putting them in closer contact with the Wonderbringer.  Many serve as teachers, teaching the crafts of smithing, leatherworking, lapiandry, woodworking and metalworking.  The Earthlord's clergy are expected to undergo regular strength and stamina training, a practice that keeps them physically fit for mining, smithing, or battle as needed.
It is also their duty to assist inventors and innovators, typically but not limited to master crafters, builders, smiths, and engineers.  The clergy can be found as well preaching the importance of a solid foundation in life.  Often adopting the "Slow and Steady" approach, speaking out against those who preach of needless change.

%^ORANGE%^Regards to Undead - %^RESET%^The faith of Grumbar is rather neutral in its outlook on undead.  Those followers that favor neutrality or good of course abhor the use of undead, seeing it a robbing the earth.  While those of more sinister persuasions find that undead is just another way to use the resources of the earth to accomplish their goals.

%^ORANGE%^Titles Given to Priests -%^RESET%^ Novices Grumbarryan are referred to as the Unspoken.  Upon becoming full priests the titles given in ascending order are, Faithful Bedrock, Granite Flagstone, Righteous Rock, Buttress of the Faith, Steadfast Pillar, Devoted Tribune, Loyal Architrave, Founding Fist, Unchanging Bastion, Surmounting Arch, Loyal Vault, and Keystone of Grumbar.
%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^The Sardonyx Knights is the crusading order of the faith.  The knights guard holy sites of the faith against infidels and lead the few field actions the church undertakes.  They are also responsible for punishing those members of the faith who forswear oaths they have taken.
%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^Within the Earthlord's faith there is a rather small group of rangers.  These warriors of nature often are found underground, exploring caverns and caves for the wonders that is Grumbar.  They work to protect those creatures who make their homes in the earth, and fight against those that would defile or despoil the treasures that the Wonderbringer keeps.%^RESET%^

%^ORANGE%^Vestments - %^RESET%^Grumbarryan tend to be large, solid men, and the ceremonial vestments of the faith aim to make them look as large (and in their minds stable) as possible.  Ritual garb includes a brown cassock, belted at the waist; a brown leather hood or hat; a huge cloak of gray-green and rust brown with artificially extended and stiffened shoulder pads that make the wearer look as wide as she or he is tall; platform clogs- worn over soft leather boots for holy rituals.  When adventuring the clergy of Grumbar tend to stick to earth tone colored clothing, gray, or black.  They understand bulky clothing offers little real protection from a knife thrust or fired arrow.  Bulky armor is another matter entirely, and Grumbarryan wear the most protective armor they can afford, usually crafted themselves.
