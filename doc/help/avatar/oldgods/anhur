%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^History - %^BLUE%^Anhur was a former member of the ancient Tsarven pantheon whom was presumed dead after the pantheon's destruction in ancient times.  After his resurrection at the hands of a secretive cult, along with the aid of Northern adventurers during the winter of 685 SG, his faith has seen a revival among the Tsarven Empire, and has made some inroads among the young of the North.

%^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^Day to Day Activities - %^BLUE%^Priests of Anhur spend their morning hours practicing their martial skills.  Afternoon hours are spent drilling and practicing battle tactics.  Evenings are spent repairing weapons and studying war strategies.  Anhur expects his clergy to develop and execute unorthodox and daring plans to win battles.  As such, much of his clergy's time is spent pursuing fantastic plans.  In addition, the clergy of Anhur sponsors a month-long tournament during the month of Springstime, a month they call the Time of Storms and claim Anhur walks the realms.  The winner of the combat is known as the Champion of Anhur for the following year.  A somber festival called the Remembrance Ritual is observed on the last day of Harvestdays, and it is a day of self-reflection and a time to honor fallen comrades.  The festival ends on a joyous note with a litany of martial hymns thanking Anhur for military successes in the past year.  Finally, the priests of Anhur often sponsor contests of physical prowess as well as lend their expertise in battle and in training for causes they support.

%^YELLOW%^Regards to Undead - %^BLUE%^Anhur abhors the use of undead and believes that those who have fallen should be allowed to remain in peace, no matter their moral bent in life.  They often aid priests of Kelemvor after battles to handle the remains of the deceased in the way most appropriate to the region.

%^YELLOW%^Titles Given to Priests - %^BLUE%^All priests of Anhur are addressed in public as "Lord Priest" or "Lord High Priest" (if of twentieth level or higher).  Within their own ranks, priests of Anhur use the titles Bloodletter, Warmaker, Honor Brother or Sister, Swordarm, Lionclaw, Defender, and Commander.  The hierarchy of titles seems to be somewhat loose, though clerics of Anhur always know where they stand in relation to one another.

%^YELLOW%^Vestments - %^BLUE%^Priests of Anhur dress very practically and deck themselves out in the most appropriate form of armor available while going about their daily business.  When in ceremonial dress, the clergy of the Falcon of War wear kalasiris (white, tight-fitting, linen skirts stretching from the waist to the knees), sandals laced to the knee, and a practical headdress.  They also wear a utilitarian pectoral collar that serves as a lower coif and breastplate as well as armlets and decorative bracers.  Priests of Anhur typically shave their heads bald and paint three blue circles on their foreheads indicating their status as priests.  Some dye their skin a reddish tint and tattoo the image of fierce monsters they have slain on their chests.  High-ranking priests may also wear bejeweled gold pectorial collars shaped in the image of a lion and drape the skin of a great cat over their shoulders.  The affluence of a priest's vestments loosely indicate his relative wealth, power, and prestige.
