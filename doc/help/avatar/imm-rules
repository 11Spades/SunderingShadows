RULES FOR IMMORTALS - Avatar and Wiz levels
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=

There is a one strike rule.  Break a rule or violate our trust and you're gone.  If in doubt, ask questions and wait for an answer.  If you violate our trust badly enough, your characters will be rid too. 

You have a position of responsibility to other immortals and the game.  We expect you to demonstrate you are conscious of your limitations (of knowledge) and boundaries of what you are allowed to or should do.  If we need to enforce those by watching you or making rules for things that should be common sense to someone who is conscientious about the rules, you'll convince us that you aren't immortal material.

Bypassing any type of security or controls that are meant to limit access or knowledge of what a higher level immortal is doing is clearly violating our trust.  

Do NOT use your immortal powers to benefit your PC or friends.  That falls under common sense.

Abuse of OOC info. and giving away OOC info. takes on a whole new meaning and level of severity with immortals.  Don't do it with your immortal or with your characters.  

We don't care how well you trust your friends, don't trust them with info. that can be used against you or other immortals or the game, period.  Human nature is such that people sometimes get mad and say things without thinking and then things get ugly.  Remember the one strike rule and don't put yourself at risk.

Be very very very careful what you talk about in tells because replies get accidentally intercepted all too often.  If you screw up and it looks like you gave something away accidentally, make up a plausible cover story to "fix" it.  Deny everything but lie as little as possible.  We don't want players to not trust us when they should.

There is a time out from playing to give you a clean break to help make the shift into thinking like an immortal.  You are not a player with an immortal, you are now an immortal that will be allowed to continue to have PCs.  You need to be able to focus on the big picture without the distraction from and relapses into thinking like a player from continuing to play while you learn the ins and outs.  

Anything that could be perceived as "advances" or other attempts to use your immortal to develop a "relationship" outside the game is inappropriate and unwelcome.

The time out from playing is generally 2-4 weeks for an avatar.  For apprentice wizzes it is usually until after their project is approved and they are promoted.  Apprentices and builders are not allowed any contact with players.  That also means do _not_ use any commands or evals on PCs such as to check stats, notes, gear, watch what they are doing, etc. - period.

You are to get specific permission from an admin. (member of the law group) before returning to play a PC (even making a newbie).  At that point you can ease back into playing but are expected to continue to spend adequate time with your immortal to continue to improve your understanding of the issues (or coding) and contribute.  Yes, you are volunteering your time and we appreciate that.  However, you have access to information and influence on the game that carries a responsibility to keep in touch with the difficulties we face from day to day and do your share to help out.  On the other hand, if your character is involved in a plot that could create a conflict of interest to find out things as an immortal, it can be a good idea to take a break for that period from logging in your immortal.  Just keep us posted.

Don't try to raise your levels or otherwise affect your "status" in the heirarchy.  Likewise, avatars need to watch for getting the avatar level accidentally set low and showing up to mortals in notify when they log in and out.

============================
Cliff notes version/summary:
============================
Get permission from an admin. before returning to playing a PC.
Think like an immortal first and a player second.
Don't ask, don't tell (who is who of immortal PCs, especially yours to players/friends).
Take appropriate time outs between logging in as your immortal and your PC(s).  
Limit the # of PCs you have and do your share as an immortal.
Be very careful of perceptions and do not abuse your power or access to info.
Avoid involvement with your PC's active friends/activities where possible.
Be extra careful about potential for/perceptions of conflict of interest (benefiting your PC by what you do with your immortal including putting items in game, changing things, "finding" things you put in, affecting plots, etc.).
Abuse of ooc info. takes on a whole new meaning at the immortal level.  Be careful!
Remember the one strike rule.
