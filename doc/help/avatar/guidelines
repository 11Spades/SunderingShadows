Some common sense/guideline type things to expand on the rules for immortals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't carry much in coins or gear.  Pickpocket mobs won't ignore your avatar/wiz.  Also, accidents happen and you may bug or be killed and leave things laying around that PCs shouldn't have/get.

You are an immortal first and a player second now.  You have a higher standard to live up to.  In exchange for the access you have to information and effect on the game and the time spent supporting and training you, we expect a certain return of your time and effort.  Not only should you set a good example by following the guidelines about limiting alts, you will be hard pressed to do justice to more than one character and your responsibilities as an immortal.

Don't go poking around in areas you don't know well as a player or playing around with your personas or immortal just to see what you can kill or how things work.  If you have a legit. reason to be testing or poking around someplace questionable, keep a higher level informed what you are up to.

If at some point you are no longer willing or able to do justice to having an immortal, please give us the courtesy of discussing it with an admin.  We will need to decide if it needs put on ice for a while or so perhaps we can help you get back on track.

Don't use your immortal to benefit yourself as a player in any fashion.  Avoid things that could be even perceived or suspected as misusing the power or info. you have as an immortal.  Be sure to take adequate breaks between logging in your immortal and PCs.  Rules against multi-playing also/especially apply to immortals for all the obvious reasons.

A simple example that most don't think about is one Cyric follows.  If he's going to log in as his PC, he does that before logging in as an avatar.   That leaves no room for doubt or suspicion that he decided to play or do something based on info. he got as an immortal.  Logging in your immortal for a brief time and then switching to a PC just plain looks suspicious.  If you aren't paranoid enough to realize that, learn to be.

Put helping PCs that your PC has no connection to (or even enemies of) first, before doing anything that benefits your PC or his/her allies.  On the flip side, leave working with your PC's allies to the others as much as possible.  With our small player base that's tough and not always possible but be extra careful of perceptions.  If in doubt in any situation, err on the side of caution and think about what players (or other immortals) would think if they noticed/knew the connection.

Ignore/forget things you know as an immortal about other characters & players while you're playing (and talking with anyone out of game).  Obviously if you see cheating report it, if you suspect ooc abuse or see things you would note as an immortal, make those notes when you next log in as your immortal.  And, above all like a hm, do your best and go out of your way to set the right example.

It's also best to avoid even watching the PC's you RP with regularly.  It becomes more difficult to keep track of what your character should know when you've seen or heard things that are relevant to things you're involved in.

Be sure to ask yourself is it curiosity as to what you're missing or do you have a really good reason as an immortal to be doing/watching something rather than doing something else with others.  If nothing else it makes it easier to keep what you know separate.  The less you see that your PC might be affected by, the less you have to worry about forgetting when you play. 

Although our immortals are characters in a sense, we're not RPing when we're dealing with each other.  We should be treating each other and the players with the kind of respect for personal space and restraint from unwanted advances we would show in a workplace.  If you're not familiar with what would constitute sexual or other types of harassment in a workplace, find out.  That sort of behavior will not be tolerated here either.  

Please do not put another immortal or especially a player in a position of having to _tell_ you that your behavior or innuendo is inappropriate.  Don't make PCs targeted to hook up with a specific person your player has decided they want to start a relationship with, etc., etc.  Yes, we've had problems so this is prevention.

Right and wrong don't always save us if those who see the results have good reason to perceive differently.  Note that I say good reason.  There will always be someone complaining about something based on speculation.  We just have to do our best to shut them down with facts or ignore them.

Don't ask, don't tell, and deny _everything_ to mortals.  If they think they know game mechanics, even if they are correct, don't confirm it and point out that things change, etc. so it's pointless to try to keep up with exactly how this or that works.

Don't tell your friends, etc. that you even have an immortal.  People you think you can trust may not be able to avoid expecting something and put you in a bad position.  They may tell someone else they think _they_ can trust (that you wouldn't trust and then it gets out of control), or have it skew their view of things in general.  They might also get mad over something and spout off in anger or frustration.  You also don't need to confirm to other (especially lower level immortals) who your active PC(s) are.  In fact, normally it's best to keep it a secret.
