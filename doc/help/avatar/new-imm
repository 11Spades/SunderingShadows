A lot of new immortals fall into the trap of thinking it has been just another logical progression.  newbie - player - HM - immort.  It's not though.  Being an immortal is completely different from being a player.  It will never be as fun for most and it is not as addictive.  You will never get sucked into being an immortal.  Our goal is to create a fun and fair environment for the players, and it takes real comittment to do this.  The threat of bias or corruption is always there, and must be guarded against.

To truly be effective, you must set aside time for the specific activities that make you successful, be it running plots or coding items or whatever.  It's not something that just happens, like playing.  It's a conscious choice - you _choose_ to be a good immort.  This is not to say you must give up your character, but there are some people who never seem to realize that it is a choice to be an immortal, to improve the experience for others at the expense of their own fun and enjoyment.  We are all part of something that is larger than any one person can create on their own and that carries a responsibility to do your fair share of what it takes to make the game fun for players and to continuously improve.

I have made a choice and I have comittment, do you?
