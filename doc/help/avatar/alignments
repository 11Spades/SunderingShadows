Note:  For this purpose you and your refers to your character and their actions/thinking

First, your alignment is something developed over the years before you became a part of the realm of SG.  It is considered to be so deeply ingrained in your personality that it is not readily subject to change.  Also, although evil people may not think of themselves as wrong or evil, you are expected to RP your every action as being consistent with being evil and you do realize that you are fundamentally different than the good or neutrals.  You won't get along well with neutrals and will have obvious major issues with good people because you consider them wrong, weak, and/or a threat to your way of life and doing things.

Also, let's recall that adventurers by definition are the ones out actively affecting the world around them.  You aren't just bystanders, ordinary citizens, or shopkeepers trying to make a living.  Evil is actively trying to get ahead and change the world so it's easier for them to do so.  They want to weaken and get rid of the good people and then the neutrals who would like to impose their morality on them or restrict them from taking advantage of the weak and helpless, etc.  Good adventurers are the ones who are actively doing the protecting to make the world a better/safer place.  Neutrals actively seek a balance between the two.

Chaos versus law and the neutral between those two are critical to how your character relates to the world and achieves those goals.  They are as important to your RP as the evil/good axis and in the case of knights, lawfullness (order/rules/their code) is the strongest factor.
----------------------------------
Let's look at an example - an evil person claims to "care for" or "be friends with" a good person and says they'll "change."  We seem to have to address/correct the thinking on both sides of these situations all too often.

First, all forms of evil are by their very nature selfish.  So, by definition they are selfish in any relationship (friendship, business, romantic, whatever).  If you are RPing an evil alignment correctly, there will always be the intent to gain more than the cost for your efforts.  Any attempt to change is only going to be superficial.  

If the good person requires the evil person do a "good" deed to prove to them and the gods that they are changing, the evil person is still motivated by selfishness.  It may be simply that they want the good person to like them or whatever.  Regardless, that selfish motivation will be, again by definition, the reason they did it.  So, they haven't really changed, their motivation was still evil even if the act resulted in something good being done.  In the end, their very nature is that they expect to get enough back from the person/people who know about it that it was worth the cost to them (if anything) and they are no less evil than they were before.

So, maybe they start doing good deeds on their own?  Still, what is the motivation?  If they are doing it so that others see it or so they can report back to the one they want to like them that they did it, their motivation is still selfish.  They are using it to further their own interests, not out of true charity or goodness.  So, again, no real change has occurred.

You can of course rationalize that that isn't the motivation, but let's get back to the definition.  If you are RPing your alignment correctly as an evil person, you simply have NOT changed.  By definition there is an evil motivation to do what you did and therefore no change is occuring.

Now, from the good person's perspective on that situation.  Good by definition is actively doing good deeds and trying to make the world a better place.  They may indeed protect the innocent and helpless, but evil adventurers and even neutrals, are certainly not innocent or helpless.

They should have had enough life experiences in what led them to be good (parents' or mentors' teachings, actual experience, or whatever) to have seen and expect evil to try to trick them and use them.  In this genre, they are very aware of evil being an ever-present danger and threat to their way of life that must be stopped and/or avoided.  They will be very careful when aiding people because they know an evil person or even a neutral may later attack them or those they care about and should be protecting.

So, claiming ignorance is no excuse for good to aid an evil person unless you've already gone to great lengths to confirm they are worthy of your friendship and help.  Only a person with both a very low wisdom and very low intelligence is going to be gullible enough to "help" just anyone.  Even then, they would be still be wary of anyone that they knew or heard had done evil acts and be duly afraid of the evil one because of the conditioning that made them good to begin with.
--------------------------------
Yes, that creates some dilemmas for those who wish to try to "change" someone, but there are game play reasons that we require changes to approved.  Even then, we expect them to be the result of in-game years of consistent RP in gradual change from in-game influences that would be readily apparent to those who know the character.  So, essentially any attempt to get someone to "change" is to be done with the expectation and IC knowledge that they are unlikely to be able to overcome their long history of being what they are.  

Sure, the good person may be enough influence to keep the evil one from doing as much evil when they're with them to watch.  Or, the evil person may cause the good person to temporarily have bad judgement and look the other way when they do something evil or even help them a little.  However, eventually the good person will realize their mistake and be compelled to do extra good deeds to make up for it.
****************************************************
The long time span required when an alignment change is allowed is for game play reasons as well as the belief that alignments cannot so readily change.  It is especially important for the continuity of RP.  In reality you don't see all those other PC's your character knows very regularly because everyone has limitations on being here 24/7 like their character would be in reality.  In game we would expect much more regular contact between characters.  So, we can't have someone you have been RPing with as a good ally, suddenly the next time they see you a RL week or month later, kill you because they became evil and you had no warning (with minor exceptions due to divine intervention or long absences of course).  Or likewise, your arch enemy suddenly be the same alignment you are.

Here's a thought on a generic help evil file, that might give the general idea of evil to help supplement the others.  I'm thinking we may need one with examples for law/neutral/chaos as well as good/neutral/evil in addition to the specific ones.  Or at least add to the existing ones with examples.

Although evil people may not think of themselves as wrong or evil, you are expected to RP your every action as being consistent with being evil.  You can lie and claim to be otherwise, but even then there should be some indications somewhere that people would suspect it.  Maybe when asked why you would kill something, you have no reason.  Maybe when you talk about why you did something it's clearly for selfish reasons, or you seem confused about why anyone would risk their life or make sacrifices for someone else.
