 Basic organization:

9/13/2003: Readded HM general topic. Added Rules, Policies, Guidelines
 Roleplaying, Deities, Faq, Classes, Races, and cleared the redundancy
out of the directories that was causing some things to not work as expected.

Did some decisions about what went into rules, and what went into policies
and what went into guidelines / roleplay. We might want to get rid of
one (or more) of these categories if they appear to be redundant or unneeded.

Added the FAQ category as well. Was thinking it might be better to split
the FAQ up and have it recompiled by a script/daemon?

But I don't have energy to do that yet.
