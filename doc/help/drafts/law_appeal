If you have cause to appeal a ruling made by an immortal, the recourse is to the law wizzes.  This is to prevent going from one immortal to another, until you get the answer you want (or like the least.)

If you are appealing a decision, law will need to review the original information and the previous immortal's decision.  You must, therefore, clearly indicate that this is an appeal of a decision, what the decision was, and who rendered the decision (if you know.)... It may take some time for the appeal to be decided on, and Law may simply choose to uphold the previous immortal's decision for any reason, even if that reason is simply that Law felt that the immortal had good reason to act as they did and continue the flow of the game.

If you fail to tell Law that you are appealing a decision, your appeal will be denied, or if it is already granted, will be reversed to the original decision, and further appeals on that case will be denied.

You can appeal a decision by one of the Law wizzes to the other law wizzes, unless the decision was made by the entirety of the law wizzes in unanimous aggreement.
