The druid is a subject of the forest and the living.
You have to obey the laws Mother Nature has drawn up
in all her goodness and grandness.
Life as a druid is a life of neutrality. A true druid
will be always neutral and will so benefit of all the
powers of nature. The more you survey the ways of
Panoramix the nestor of all druids, the more you will
learn to love AND control the nature around you.

If you have any questions, just ask the druidmaster who
will always be there for all your druidic questions.

To become a druid you need a 12 stat for wisdom and a 15 stat for charisma.
Only humans and half-elfs can become Druids.
