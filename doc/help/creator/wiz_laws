            RESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING PLAYERS

1. Now that you are a wizard you are entrusted with certain
amounts of access and commands to help with the creation of
this MUD. Your creations along with others are to help ensure
that the players have fun and return for further enjoyment.
As a wizard this means you are not allowed to abuse your powers
by showing off to players.

2. The interaction with players is to be very limited since in
the past we have had many problems concerning this. If a wizard
wishes to interact with a player he/she must log off as their 
wizard and back on with a LEGAL character. The only exception to
this rule would be if the wizard needed a player to test a legit-
amate project for the mud and needed a players input. If wizards
are caught interacting with players for any other reason the
following will apply:
 
              Jail Time               Reason
         ^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^
              40 minutes           Messing with Player
              60 minutes           Messing with Player against
                                   their will
             120 minutes           Messing with Player and
                                   harm is done

   If further episodes occur then other action may be taken to
encourage it to stop, like short term demotions.
	Note that the spirit of this rule is to keep any "relationships"
away from players and wizes. These can include both negative and
positive feelings. In other words we do not want a potential of
favortism or retaliation towards or against players. To punctuate
this point all wizes are open to snooping, players are however not.
Thus, invading a player's privacy is also considered in the above.

3.  As a wizard you will have access to many files and a number
of codes. It is illegal to steal code from this MUD in order to
supply another MUD with it. If you are caught doing this you will
lose all privilages of being a wizard. However all wizes should
that files in /d are open to use by all wizes, this is how we extend
knowledge and skill. If you have a monster/item in the game that
you want to be unique flag it in a header. That will b just marking.

4.  Disputes with players is not uncommon, but this does not release you
from your responsibilities. Using your powers to harass, scare, or         
otherwise effect a user for the worse is illegal and can result in 
instant demotion.

5.  If a player dies due to a bug in the mud you are only to 
reimburse that player equal to what they had before they died
and no more then that.

             RESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING WIZES

1.  Since as a wizard you will be able to scan other wizards
code it is a common courtesy here that if you wish to copy
another wizes code from their home directory, you ask first.

2.  Disputes with other wizards is not uncommon but if it is
something serious you need to inform law. If it is not all
that serious please bring it to an admins attention so that
it can be dealt with quickly and doesnt escalate into something
serious at a later date. It is an abuse of power to harrass a 
wizard that has upset you, and the spreading of rumors to under-
mine said wizard is illegal and both offenses will carry a 
heavy penalty. Disputes among wizards is to remain just that,
between the wizards, players are not to be dragged into it.

3.  All wizards have the right to code in privacy without
interruption. Please be considerate when interrupting another
wizard in the middle of their coding.

                      GENERAL RULES

1.  The presence of wiz tools is permitted on the MUD as long as  
they fulfill a purpose that cannot be carried out with existing
commands AND do not allow illegal actions that would compromise
the balance and secruity of the MUD.

2.  Blatant disrespect for an admin or a fellow wizard is not 
proper and in some cases is punishable.

3.  Trying to gain unauthorized filesystem access is illegal and
carries a heavy penalty.

					 RIDDABLE OFFENSES
				
1. The largest of these is a clear and present danger to the mud.
In many cases code stealing can be interpretted as such. Attempted
hacking or breaching security are also examples.

2. Repeated offenses against players and other wizes. Such actions
that could be interpretted as a constant threat to players' and wizes' 
well being. 

3. A constant idleness in coding. Not in just not logging in but in 
production of code. Obviously people will have down periods, and
a simple notifacation will serve to alert us to your potential 
absense.
