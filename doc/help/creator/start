As an immortal new to the immortal reality of ShadowGate, your are
obligated to read a certain set of documents before going on to coding. 
On ShadowGate, immortality is not a reward for "winning the game" or being
a great player. Instead, it is an alternative to playing the game.  There
is no point at which a player wins on ShadowGate, just like in life.  At a
certain point, however, (unlike life) a player is given the opportunity to
become immortal. And you have chosen that path.  That means that you no
longer belong in the realm of the mortal, and your participation in our
reality has taken on a different character. 

The first thing you should do is read all docs in /doc/help/creator.
This can be accomplished by either typing 'help *creator general' or
going to the directory itself, and using more.

Be sure to pay special attention to the files 'approval' and 'new_coder'. 
They will give you information on the process you must follow to get your 
code added to the mud, as well as how the promotions are earned.

If you know nothing about LPC, you should read the documents in /doc/lpc.
Granted they are weighty and hard to follow for someone with little 
programming experience, but you do not need to be able to understand it in
detail in order to code.  In order to be able to code, you simply need to
get the drift of those docs.

Also you will find that there are a few tutorials in the /doc/help/creator.
These documents tell you the specifics of building rooms, monsters, 
weapons, armour, and other items.  After reading these documents,
you should now know enough to code a decent area.  

The other documents in the /doc directory are supplementary docs and
You do not need to read them in order to function as an immortal in the
ShadowGate reality.  But at some point you may indeed find them useful.
