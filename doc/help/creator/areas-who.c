I'm sure I'll miss a few, but here goes a stab at the major groups at least along with some things I know of that could use some attention in some of them.

%^YELLOW%^/d/antioch %^RESET%^- Crystal's - including the city, valley, ruins

%^YELLOW%^/d/attaya %^RESET%^- open - Seneca and all on the island - needs balanced/use of CROOM and not repop every reset for longer reboots and true explorability for parties who don't use ooc info.

%^YELLOW%^/d/azha %^RESET%^- open (was Thorn's) - I think only the city is actually still open

%^YELLOW%^/d/dagger%^RESET%^ - all open since Grendel is working on lib and driver stuff ?
 - /Daggerdale - open (I did Vethor's thief guild thing there)
 - /Torm - whatshisname that coded drunk too often and is gone.  It has an underground
area that was largely done and could use to be reviewed and possibly fixed up and
opened some day
 - /armor - goes with the mobile shop ???
 - /cave1 & /cave2 - open - ogre caves - needs balanced for longer reboots and less
hack and slash, maybe add some variety in gear
 - /derro - open - wandering mobs need changed to CROOM, it has a few buggy traps, and as I recall a lot of the code was copy/paste from not so good examples
 - /drow (was Grazzt's I think) - open
 - /kinaro - was Grendel's - make the gear available without killing the mobs, esp. the small silvered fullplate on the dwarven armorsmith?
 - /marsh - open - marsh for mids and Demongate tower - needs balanced/use of CROOM and not repop every reset for longer reboots and true explorability for parties who don't use ooc info. or let someone who knows it lead
 - /road & /tonovi - Grendel's I think
 - /Elvante, /elements, /keep, /lost, /phederia, /temp, /test, /virtual - not used, salvageable? ? 
 - /aketon - Obsidian's with help from Crystal on the trees, mobs are buggy and code is old so it's not close to being able to be opened

%^YELLOW%^/d/darkwood%^RESET%^
 - /camps - Dinji's orc and elven camps
 - /forest - open - was Mercutio's - forest south and east of Shadow
 - /room - open - road between Shadow & Tharis and Rhapsody Inn rooms
 - /tabor - open, was Thorn's
   Not in game - ????
    /castle (goes with Tabor?), /darcy, /dforest, /waterhaven, /watermargin, /zin
    /equip, /mon, /obj, /weaps - go with one of the areas that aren't open? 

%^YELLOW%^/d/deku%^RESET%^ - open
  I updated and fixed up a lot of it right after my apprenticeship and added a lot of inherits, but there was a lot I still didn't know to fix and/or didn't get to either such as the fortress.  
 - Dinji is working on Sanctuary, including adding a quest
 - The Stones Quest needs changed to be less repeatable and Jarrow replaced
 - I'd like for the keep to be turned into something more useful and interesting and the shops are way out of date and probably should just be closed
/d/dragon was the old Sanctuary that we're moving into /d/deku as Dinji fixes it up

%^YELLOW%^/d/islands%^RESET%^
 - /argentrock - open, was Obs gets overrun with too many mobs if stirred up for long, needs to use CROOM or something but will be tricky the way the mobs are spawned
 - /common includes aramanth & eldebaro & several that aren't open
 - /dallyh (Amazons) - open
 - /dinosaur - Grendel's, some areas not open yet?
 - /pirates (includes the caves) open
 - /tonerra (including lava tubes & monestary) - open (was at least partly T's?)
	lava tubes at least need some bug fixes, CROOM for longer reboots, and terrain/travel added
   Not in game that I recognize -
      /carcosa, /darkportal, /giant, /illusion, /japan, /volcania

%^YELLOW%^/d/koenig%^RESET%^ - open - Muileann, stream, dusty road and orc camps - needs a lot of code updates

%^YELLOW%^/d/laerad%^RESET%^ - open - including troll village and laerad caves
  - /parnelli/asgard/sewers - Diego
  God plains need a theme and change from hack and slash and now that we have more lower level areas, put low level bracers elsewhere and make it more like 15+ or even higher.  Dinji has been giving it some thought and has some ideas
  Laerad caves need mob control, CROOM? and maybe still need terrain/travel added to the lower part

%^YELLOW%^/d/newbie/rooms%^RESET%^ - mostly open - Vetri, Obs, and Crystal did quite a bit of it
 - /drow - Diego
 - /forest - Styx
 - /hill - Vetri but I added some mobs and finished up parts
 - /keep - Crystal
 - /road, /roadout - Styx
 - /ruins - Vetri with mobs added by Styx
 - /temples - Styx
 - /town - open, was a real collaboration
 - /mons, etc. generally are for the town or area as a whole

%^YELLOW%^/d/player_houses%^RESET%^ 
   /daelmas, /isaiah, /lusell, /melic, /saradin, ?? - Diego
   /abrahil, /girruuth, /lahnna, /slore, /solaren updated to new mage guild - Styx
   I think the rest need adopted

%^YELLOW%^/d/player_stores%^RESET%^ - Styx

%^YELLOW%^/d/shadow%^RESET%^
 - /guilds - open - the class guild halls
 - /juran - Diego
 - /virtual - open but tricky so I'll take it - 
	Shadow desert, ocean, river ferries
 - /room includes
	/cave - Dragon's Den - Circe is working on changes to the Pipe Quest there
	/city - open - Shadow city
	/forest - open roads around Shadow including to Juran
	/goblin - open - updated by Styx & Diego a while back, still needs more review
	/kildare - Circe's village and peryton area
	/main - open - gates and a few Shadow city rooms, no idea why they are separate
	/meadows - Crystal's meadowlands
 	/mountain - Echoes Mtns
	/pass - Dragon pass road
	/village - road just west of Shadow and old versions of shopkeepers?
   not in game - ???
	/beach, /chaos, /maze, /pepitom, /tour, /troll

%^YELLOW%^/d/stella%^RESET%^ - I'll take since I've worked on it some already - Stellar castle/maze

%^YELLOW%^/d/tharis%^RESET%^ - open except palace is Diego's
  (much of it was T's I think) Tharis city, forest, sewers
  - /Tharis - city
  - /barrow - barrow downs
  - /conforest - connecting Tharis forest to darkwood, etc. (small) ?
  - /forest - Tharis forest proper
  - /monsters & /obj - mobs & stuff for most of the areas in the directory
  - /palace - Diego's
  - /road - road around and east of Tharis
   I've fixed a lot of the bugs so I may take this one too except for Diego's palace
  no longer in game ??
    /ainvar, /cave1, /caverns, /nolesti, /virtual

%^YELLOW%^/d/undead%^RESET%^ - open, island of Graez/Sangri
  - coded by Void, horribly buggy and copy/paste edited badly
  needs bug fixes as reported but maybe should just be closed rather than given the effort to clean it all up - low on the priority list due to the effort it will take to fix properly

Not in game in /d/
 - /alpine, /cursed, /khalian, /kravor, /mine, /mine2, /player.village, /priest, /ptalkin, /ravenloft, /sands, /spell (empty dir), /standard, /tsarven, /verhedin

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
OK, here's a summary of areas that have active wizzes or I'll take.  I'll probably turn this into a topic on the posters and maintain it there once we get more volunteers.

/d/antioch - Styx for Crystal

/d/darkwood/camps - Dinji

/d/deku/sanctuary - Dinji adopted

/d/laerad/parnelli/asgard/sewer/ - Diego

/d/newbie/rooms/drow - Diego
/d/newbie/ the rest  - Styx &/or Styx will adopt

/d/player_houses
   /daelmas, /isaiah, /lusell, /melic, /saradin, ?? - Diego
   /abrahil, /girruuth, /lahnna, /slore, /solaren updated to new mage guild - Styx
   I think the rest need adopted

/d/player_stores - Styx (so far)

/d/shadow/juran - Diego
/d/shadow/room/cave  - Circe adopted
/d/shadow/room/mountain - Circe adopted
/d/shadow/room/kildare - Circe
/d/shadow/room/meadows - Styx for Crystal
/d/shadow/room/city - jail - Styx, guards Tristan with updates by Styx

/d/stella - Styx adopted

/d/Tharis/palace - Diego

Of course /d/Shadowgate, /d/magic/, and most anything not /d/... have restricted access so most of those will have to be T, Grendel, Garrett, Pator, or Styx, depending on who has time or the expertise although I think Diego has access to at least /cmds and /d/magic too
