Builders and Coders Wanted:
______________________________________


	ShadowGate MUD (MudOS 0.9.20, overhauled Nightmare mudlib) 
is looking for people to help us write areas for a medieval themed 
AD&D MUD.  There are two types of openings that we have for
immortals: builders and coders.  
	Coders write the unique code for the domain that they are working on.  
Examples of this are traps, unique monsters, magic items, etc.  Anything 
that requires new coding would be handled by the area coders.  If you
have never coded, if you don't have quite enough time to code, or if
you would like to code but need to get some experience, then read on.
	Builder is a new position on ShadowGate that makes life easier for the 
coders and can benefit new wizards.  ShadowGate is right now putting
the finishing touches on our Room maker code for online, UNIX and DOS use.
This means that users who have little or no experience with coding
can help out and make rooms en-masse.  This relieves the coders of the
job of thinking up both the code for the room and also spending the
time writing room descriptions and connecting the rooms, etc.  Because
the room maker requires little or no knowledge of coding, we can use
just about ANYBODY who has a good imagination and some time.  Further,
since builders are wizard characters as well, they are free to look 
over code and get some coding experience on their own.  
	The reqirements for positions differ, of course, but they both are
similar when it comes to flexibility on the part of the admins.  For
coder openings we would prefer people who have had some experience coding
on a LP mud running under MudOS, however if you have any kind of programming
experience, either in real life or on MUDs, we invite you to come on over.  
Those people who have coded in C or C++ will find the transition to LPC
very easy to make.  
	If you are interested in a builder position, the only requirements are
that you know how to telnet, ftp and have general computing knowledge.  In
a nutshell, if you are reading this right now, you probably already meet the
requirements.  People interested in the builder position will find some
playing experience on MUDs to be helpful, but such experience is not required.
	Here's a little information on us:
	
**Driver -- MudOS 0.9.20
**Mudlib -- based on Nightmare 3.2 but extremely modified
**Theme -- medieval AD&D, main city based on Waterdeep,
but lots of room for new additions.  Areas can be just
about anything as long as they are not too far from the 
medieval theme.
**Features -- Players inventories are saved after quits and
reboots, players start in the same room where they quit
allowing for continuous adventuring in an area.  Completely
reworked magic system to fit AD&D rules (includ. material
components), ANSI color and more....

	If you have any questions or if you are interested in one of these
positions contact:
