		A tutorial specifically for the hotel object.

A sample hotel:

inherit HOTEL;

void create() {
    ::create();
    set_property( "light" , 1); 
    set_property("indoors" , 1);
    set_short("Home.");
    set_long(
	"The Hotel."
      );
    set_exits( ([
	"south":"/d/shadow/room/city/eastgate"
             ]) );
    set_rooms(([
	"single":1,
	"double":2,
	"triple":3,
	"quad":4,
	]));
    set_cost(10);
}

As you can see, most of it is a basic room. For info on the basic rooms,
read the room_tutorial. This will only cover the hotel aspect of the room.

Now, you may have noticed, there are only 3 differences from a standard room.
First, the inherit statement inherits the HOTEL object. This object 
includes the room object, with the hotel functions added.

The other difference is the set_rooms() efun.
    set_rooms(([
	"single":1,
	"double":2,
	"triple":3,
	"quad":4,
	]));

void set_rooms(mapping rooms)
The first part is the room name, as it will appear in the registar.
keep this name to 12 letters, or it will mess up the registar display.
The second is the number of beds in the room, Max is 5 beds to a room.

The last is the set_cost efun:
void set_cost(int cost)
This will set the cost of a single bed in a room with the maximum of
5 beds. For example: With set_cost(10);
Rooms with:
1  bed will cost 50 per bed.
2 beds will cost 25 per bed.
3 beds will cost 16 per bed.
4 beds will cost 12 per bed.
5 beds will cost 10 per bed.

This will add 4 add_actions to the room. read, rent, cost, and help. 
Rent allows the players to rent a room in the hotel, and automatically
logs them off of the mud. 
Read lets them see a sorted(by # of beds) list of the rooms, with the bed 
occupants.
Cost shows them a pricelist of the beds by room name, sorted by cost.
Help <hotel> will give the players help for the hotel.

It is recommended that you put something like:
<Help hotel> for a list of commands.
in your hotel description.

Well, that's it. The hotel object will handle logging the players off, 
removing them from the registar when they log back on, and all the other
little and complex things..
