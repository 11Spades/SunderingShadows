Quests on ShadowGate

A small tutorial on how to set up quests for ShadowGate.

First, let me say that we feel quests are an important part of the mud. 
They will help make it more interactive.

There are no real rules about quests, feel free to come up with some that 
are unique. We don't want hack and slash, make the players use their brains. 
Give them puzzles, tricks, traps, etc. Don't make them easy. And make them 
in such a way, that even if someone else tells a player how to complete the 
quest, they still have to work at it.

The first thing you need to do is make up a plan for the quest.
Then you'll need to make everything up that the quest needs to be completed. 

I'll use my cave quest for an example. (Pipe Quest) 

The plan:
        The player must see Bandolar first. She will ask the player to take 
        a note to her friend, in the Dragon's Den Caverns. The player will 
        have to go to the cave, find and solve the mysteries of the caves, 
        and open the door to find Bandolar's friend, Rufsu, then give her 
        the note. Rufsu completes the quest.

Creation:
        Bandolar checks to see if the player has solved the quest, and only 
        gives the note to players who haven't solved it. In the caves, there 
        are special rooms, where the player must find certain objects, needed 
        to open the door to Rufsu.Once they talk with Rufsu, she gives them a 
        reward, a pipe, and then ends the quest.

        There is one other thing you need to make to complete the quest. That 
        is the creation of the quest object.

        ::::SAMPLE::::

        #include <std.h>

        inherit "std/quest_ob";

        void create() {
           set_name("Pipe Quest");
           set_id( ({ "note", "cave note","quest_object","Pipe Quest"}) );
           set_short("Note for Rufsu");
           set_long("Give this note to the Wizard in the Dragon Den Cave");
           set_quest_points(5);
        }
        
        :::::::::::

        This is all that is needed for the quest object. This MUST be created.
        Before your quest will operate, an admin will have to copy this quest 
        object into the quest dir, which, for security reasons, is not 
        accessable to wizards.

Completion of the quest:
        At the end of the quest, you must do 2 things.
        1. Set the quest in the player:
                this_player()->set_quest("Pipe Quest");
        2. Add the experience gained from completing the quest:
                this_player()->add_exp(5000);


That is all that is needed to create a quest.
