A summary of areas that have active wizzes or have been adopted to date, for reference of who to talk to if you have an idea for an area.  Also so we know which bug and typo reports should be taken care of by a specific person and those who have time and energy can pitch in on the still orphaned areas.  %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Volunteers to adopt remaining areas will be greatly appreciated.%^RESET%^
