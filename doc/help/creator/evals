%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^NWP RELATED EVALS - Styx 12/03%^RESET%^

First always do <nwps [name]> and this so you have a complete list of what was there before in case something goes wrong
eval return find_player(string PCname)->query_nwps_mapping()

To increase a "free" nwp level:
eval return "/daemon/nwps_d.c"->advance_player(find_player(string name), string class, int level)
**NOTE - level should be the level they are in the class that the nwp is free in
If they already have the nwp, it will add one level at a time.  If it's new, it will bump them straight to the level

**NOTE - The %^GREEN%^<fixnwps>%^RESET%^ command will now do this

Don't forget the %^GREEN%^<nwpbonus>%^RESET%^ and %^GREEN%^<addnwp>%^RESET%^ commands that both avatars and wizzes have for personas or giving players a boost for good RP
