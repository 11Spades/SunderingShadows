Profs....

When we say sized that means ...
size = 1  small
       2  medium
       3  large
       4  giant

Standards 
---------
All standard swords are sized with the type "blades" however they 
default so you needn't change them.
Clubs are sized and are also defaulted. 

Types
-----
We have established the types of..

mace
fork 
blades
clublike
polearm
tool (farm equipment etc)
flail
staff 
whip
axe (sized)
hammer (sized)
long bow
short bow
spear (sized)

When should you make a new type? You should make a new type if you 
have a weapon that you feel requires special learning .. ie a tyrelk 
is a special weapon. The battle axe of the dominion has a special
point at the top so its a large pointed axe (or such). 

Using profs
-----------
funcitons of consideration....
set_prof_type(string)
set_prof_level(int)
query_level_max()
query_prof_type()


the set_prof_type is used to set the above types....
the set_max_level is used to set the level at which you can achieve 
100% proficiency (set it if yo htink it should be not sure if its to 
used)

use the querys to test the defaults etc....
