~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Player Houses Pricing Guide~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the progress made on player houses recently and the influx of 
requests we've started to get as people see these coming in game, 
it might be nice to have some sort of standardize pricing system for 
the houses.  Note that this is only a set of guidelines, and the 
price may often change based on how much gold the player has, how 
lavish the house is, if it is in a good location or not, etc.  Also 
keep in mind how the house will be used.  If you're pretty sure it's 
just going to be a hang-out/hideaway that won't add anything else to 
the game, feel free to increase the price a bit.  You can also talk to 
any of the people who have made houses and see what they've charged or 
check player notes, etc.  That said, here is a list of suggestions for 
prices and things to consider when building a player house.

     Base Price - 250,000
     Additional Rooms - 10,000 - 25,000 each
     Traps (magical or otherwise) - 50,000 each
     Mirror for Scrying - 250,000 - 500,000
     Mobs/guards - 50,000 each (don't let them go overboard
                   and the more complicated, the more expensive)
     Food/drink - 25,000 total (please limit items as much as possible)

Other special functions will occasionally be requested, and of course, 
most houses have keys.  Please keep the same key used throughout the 
house, and there should be some in game way for people other than the owner
to get keys.  Keep in mind the general pricing guidelines and use those to 
adjust the price for other special functions.  If you have questions 
about something a player requests, feel free to ask.
