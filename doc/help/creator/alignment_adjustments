WIZES LEARN TO ADD THIS STUFF I PUT IN

Okay this is really simple.
To make a monster that effects the alignment of the players
attacking it all that needs to be added to the monster is:
	set_property("alignment adjustment",#);
	
	the # is a number between -10 and 10 
	-10 meaning that this action is really evil
	and 10 meaning that it's good and stuff
	
So lost child would be 
		set_property("alignment adjustment",-9);

killing it would be pretty evil!

So a horrid tyrant who eats children would be
		set_property("alignment adjustment",9);
		
killing it would be pretty good!

easy no?


Okay in rooms to have the alignment adjust to actions and such.

You will need to add the same line as above.
Then at some point in the action you will need the line
	"daemon/killing_d"->check_actions(TP,TO);
	
So stealing the sacred cross of blah blah

int get(...){
	if(id(str)){
		set_property("alignment adjustment",-5);
		KILLING_D->check_actions(TP,TP);
	}
	return 0;
}

any questions please direct them to tristan
