If you are looking to make a quest, you should first talk with a developer, overseer, or admin to make sure the quest fits with the MUD.  See <help quests> for the guidelines that have been around for years.  Basically, keep in mind the feeling of the MUD, and try to make sure your quest is intriguing, rather than just simple hack and slash.

Once you have coded the quest rooms and mobs themselves, there are a few quest specific things you must do.
- make a quest object similar to the one below:

#include <std.h>

inherit "std/quest_ob";

void create() {
set_name("Yourquestname Quest");
add_id("Yourquestname Quest");
set_quest_points(15);
}

NOTE: you must add an id - the quest room queries for these, and your quest will bug if there is no id.

- You should do two things on your mob who is controlling the quest:
     TP->set_quest("Yourquestname Quest");
     TP->fix_exp(1000,TP); - this is however much experience they should get from the quest.

- An admin must load your quest object into /d/shadowgate/quests/ and update it
- Then, the admin needs to update /d/shadowgate/misc/quest_room

After this, your quest should work fine!  Have fun, and good luck!
