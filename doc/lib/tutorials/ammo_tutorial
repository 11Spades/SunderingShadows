What must be done for the ammo object:

 #  Be sure to include the ammo object.

inherit "/std/ammo";

 # usual object set commands

   set_id(({ "arrows","quiver","missles" }));
   set_name("arrows");
   set_short("A quiver of arrows");
   set_long(
	"This is a quiver of arrows for a bow. "
   );

### sets the number of missiles in this object;

   set_shots(int missiles);

###  sets the normal damage

   set_wc(int #dice,int #ofsides);

###  sets the large damage

   set_large_wc(int #dice,int #ofsides);

Pretty simple..
