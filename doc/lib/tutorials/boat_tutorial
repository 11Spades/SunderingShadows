	Basic Intro to using Sea-Faring Craft on ShadowGate

The Boat
--- ----

	The basic boat object must inherit /std/sea/boat.c.
This is just a container object that holds a number of rooms.
These rooms are where a player can be when he is inside the boat.
When a player gives the 'board' command when he is in a room with
a boat in it, he will be moved into the room associated with the
entrance.  In order to tell a boat which room is associated with
what, you use a call to set_room.  For example,
set_room("enter","my_room");  You also must provide a limit on
the number of people who can enter the boat, using set_capacity().

The Boat Room
--- ---- ----

	The rooms on a boat determine the functions the player
can perform in that room.  There are a number of different types
of rooms that a boat can have in it.

/std/sea/shanty.c	For single-room boats, has the helm controls,
                        the enter code and the exit code.

/std/sea/broom.c	This is a basic room, with no helm, no enter,
			and no exit.  Just for filler rooms.

/std/sea/enter.c	This contains the enter and exit code, mainly
			for entrance ramps and their corresponding rooms.

/std/sea/helm.c		This has only the helm code, for ships with
			helms in seperate rooms.

Every boat room must have a call to set_enclosed().  If it is 1, you
cannot see the description of the room that the boat itself is in.
If it's 0, you have open view to the outside of the boat.

The Water Room
--- ----- ----

	Thess are the rooms that boats are allowed to travel through.  
Just inherit /std/sea/waterroom.c instead of /std/room.c and
boats will be allowed to sail through.  There are two functions
associated with the waterroom, set_depth() and set_turbulence().
Neither of these variables do anything just yet, but these are
the tables.

	Depth  Description
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	  0  |  All but the smallest ships will suffer hull damage.
	  1  |  No hull damage, but possible slow progress.
	  2  |  Typical river depth.  
	  3  |  Typical ocean depth.
	  4  |  Deep sea.
	
	Turb   Description
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	  0  |  No turbulence, calm waters.
	  1  |  Little turbulence.
	  2  |  Small whitecaps, small waves.
	  3  |  Large waves, a little rough.
	  4  |  Very rough, hard sailing.
	  5  |  Storm!  Ships will suffer hull damage.
	  6  |  Random


The Dock Room
--- ---- ----

In order for you to launch your ship into a waterroom, you must be
at a DOCK.  You must inherit /std/sea/dock in a room that you will
allow ships to launch from.  Also, rooms tagged as a dock will
be traversable by boats, as they have to land in them.  If players
sail a boat into a dock, it will automatically dock them.  In order
to set which room a dock launches boats into, you must set the
launch room with a call to set_launch_room.  For example,
set_launch_room("/d/domain/room/water1");



For More Help
--- ---- ----

	You can always take a peek at the following files to see
examples of a working ship and sets of water rooms.

/d/koenig/stream/stream1.c	Example dock room.
/d/koenig/stream/stream2-12.c	Example water rooms.
/d/koenig/obj/canoe.c		Example single-room boat.
/d/koenig/obj/canoeroom.c	Example boat room.

	And of course, just drop me a note and I can give you more
help.
