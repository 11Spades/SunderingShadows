[1mNAME[0m
       process_string() - give a string with replaced calldescriptions


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       string process_string( string combinestring );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Processes  a  string by replacing specific syntactic patterns with what
       is returned when the pattern is interpreted as a function call descrip‚Äê
       tion.

       The syntactic patterns are on the form:

                "@@function[:filename][|arg1|arg2....|argN]@@"

       This is interpreted as a call:

                 filename->function(arg1, arg2, ....., argN)

       Note  that  process_string  does  not recurse over returned replacement
       values. If a function returns another syntactic pattern, that  descrip‚Äê
       tion will not be replaced.

       All  such  occurrences  in 'combinestring' is processed and replaced if
       the return value is a string. If the return value is not a  string  the
       pattern will remain unreplaced.

       Note that both object and arguments are marked optional with the brack‚Äê
       ets and that the brackets are not included in the actual pattern.

[1mCAVEAT[0m
       This is usually used to support 'value by function call' in the mudlib.
       It  is  wise  to  set  the  effuserid  of  the object to 0 before using
       process_value as any function in any object can be called  with  almost
       any arguments.


[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       A string:
           "You are chased by @@query_the_name:/obj/monster#123@@ eastward."

       is replaced by:
           "You are chased by the orc eastward."

       Assuming that query_the_name in monster#123 returns "the orc".
