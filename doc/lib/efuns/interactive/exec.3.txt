exec(3)                      LPC Library Functions                     exec(3)



[1mNAME[0m
       exec()  - switches a player (interactive) connection from one object to
       another


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int exec( object to, object from );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This efunction allows the interactive link to  a  given  object  to  be
       migrated to another object.  That is, after a successful exec(to, from)
       call, interactive(to) will return 1 and interactive(from)  will  return
       0.   The player that was controlling 'from' will begin controlling 'to'
       following the exec() call.  Note that this is a powerful  function  and
       its use must be restricted if you wish to attempt to have a secure mud.
       The proper way to restrict the use of exec() is to make a simul_efun of
       the  same  name and then use valid_override(4) to restrict the use of a
       simul_efun override (i.e. efun::exec()).  The exec() function returns 1
       if the switch is successful (and 0 otherwise).
