[1mNAME[0m
       input_to()  - causes next line of input to be sent to a specified func‚Äê
       tion


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       varargs void input_to( string | function fun, int flag, ... );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local  function  'fun'
       as an argument. The input line will not be parsed by the driver.

       Note  that input_to is non-blocking which means that the object calling
       input_to does not pause waiting for input.  Instead the object  contin‚Äê
       ues  to  execute  any statements following the input_to.  The specified
       function

       If "input_to()" is called more than once in the  same  execution,  only
       the first call has any effect.

       If  optional  argument 'flag' is non-zero, the line given by the player
       will not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped (this is useful for col‚Äê
       lecting passwords).

       The  function  'fun'  will  be  called with the user input as its first
       argument (a string). Any additional arguments supplied to input_to will
       be passed on to
