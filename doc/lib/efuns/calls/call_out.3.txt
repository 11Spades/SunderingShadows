[1mNAME[0m
       call_out() - delayed function call in same object


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       void call_out( string | function fun, int delay, mixed arg );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Set  up  a  call of function <fun> in this_object(). The call will take
       place in <delay> seconds, with the argument <arg> provided.  <arg>  can
       be of any type.


       Please  note  that  you  can't  rely on write() or say() in <fun> since
       this_player() is set to 0. Use tell_object() instead.


       The define THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT exists to remedy the above problem.
