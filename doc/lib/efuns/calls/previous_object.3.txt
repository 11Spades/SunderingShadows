[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Returns an object pointer to the object, if any,  that  called  current
       function.   Note that local function calls do not set previous_object()
       to the current object, but leave it unchanged.  If  passed  a  positive
       integer, it goes back the given number of previous objects in the call‚Äê
       ing chain.  previous_object(0) is the same as previous_object(), previ‚Äê
       ous_object(1)  is the previous object's previous_object(), etc.  previ‚Äê
       ous_object(-1) returns an array containing all of the previous objects.
