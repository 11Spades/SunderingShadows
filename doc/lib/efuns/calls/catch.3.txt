[1mNAME[0m
       catch() - catch an evaluation error


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       mixed catch( mixed expr );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Evaluate  <expr>.  If  there  is no error, 0 is returned. If there is a
       standard error, a string (with a leading '*') will be returned.

       The function throw() can also be used to immediately return any  value,
       except 0. catch() is not really a function call, but a directive to the
       compiler.

       The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used  just  anywhere.
       Rather, use it at places where an error would destroy consistency.
