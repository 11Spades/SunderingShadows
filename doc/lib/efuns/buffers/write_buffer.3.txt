[1mNAME[0m
       write_buffer() - write a buffer to a file, or read into a buffer from a
       source


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int write_buffer( string | buffer dest, int start,
                         mixed source );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       If 'dest' is a file, then 'source' must be an int (and will be  written
       to the file in network-byte-order), a buffer, or a string, and 'source'
       will be written to the file 'dest' starting at byte # 'start'.

       If 'dest' is a buffer, then 'source' will be written  into  the  buffer
       starting  at  byte  # 'start' in the buffer.  If 'source' is an int, it
       will be written in network-byte-order.
