[1mNAME[0m
       read_buffer() - read from a file and return a buffer, or return part of
       a buffer as a string


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       string | buffer read_buffer( string | buffer src,
                                    int start,  int len );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       If 'src' is a string (filename), then the filename will be read, start‚Äê
       ing  at  byte # 'start', for 'len' bytes, and returned as a buffer.  If
       neither argument is given, the entire file is read.

       If 'src' is a buffer, then characters are read from the  buffer  begin‚Äê
       ning  at  byte  #  'start' in the buffer, and for 'len' # of bytes, and
       returned as a string.

       Note that the maximum number of bytes you can read from a file and into
       a buffer is controlled via the 'maximum byte transfer' parameter in the
       runtime config file.
