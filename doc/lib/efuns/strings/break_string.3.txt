[1mNAME[0m
       break_string() - break a string at regular intervals


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       string break_string( string str | int foobar, int len,
                            void | int indent | string indent );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  function  breaks  a  continous  string  without newlines into a a
       string with newlines inserted at every 'len':th character.

       If 'indent' is defined and is given as an integer, 'indent'  number  of
       spaces  are  inserted after every newline. If 'indent' is a string that
       string is inserted before every newline.

       If the first argument is an integer, the function simply returns 0.


[1mBUGS[0m
       break_string() is *not* context sensitive.  It does not take account of
       periods '.' and new-lines '\n'.  This means that the result is not nec‚Äê
       essarily what you would expect.  My experience is that you  should  use
       one  space  after  a period and do not embed new-lines in the text, but
       append them to the result of break_string().  If this format  does  not
       meet  your  tastes  you  may  find  break_string() to be inadequate.  A
       future revision of break_string()  may  allow  different  line-breaking
       semantics.  (Cygnus)
