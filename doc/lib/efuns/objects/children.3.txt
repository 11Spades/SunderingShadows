[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  efunction  returns an array of objects that have been cloned from
       the file named by 'name', as well  as  the  object  'name'  itself,  if
       loaded.   An example use of children() is to find all objects that have
       been cloned from the user object:

              object *list;

              list = children("/obj/user");

       This lets you find all users  (both  netdead  and  interactive  whereas
       users() only reports interactive users).
