[1mNAME[0m
       reload_object - return an object to its just-loaded state


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       void reload_object( object ob );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       When reload_object() is called on 'ob', all the driver-maintained prop‚Äê
       erties are re-initialized (heart_beat, call_outs, light, shadows, etc),
       all  variables  are  re-initialized,  and create() is called.  It has a
       similar effect to destructing/reloading the object,  however,  no  disk
       access or parsing is performed.
