[1mNAME[0m
       set_heart_beat() - enable or disable an object's heartbeat


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int set_heart_beat( int flag );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Passing 'flag' as 0 disables the object's heart beat.  Passing a 'flag'
       of 1 will cause heart_beat() to be called in the object once each heart
       beat  (a variable number defined by your local administrator, usually 2
       seconds).  Passing a 'flag' of greater than 1 will usually set the num‚Äê
       ber  of heart beats inbetween calls to heart_beat(), however your local
       administrator may have the system configured to treat any 'flag'  above
       1 as 1.
