[1mNAME[0m
       save_object() - save the values of variables in an object into a file


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int save_object( string name, int flag );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Save  all  values  of  non-static  variables in this object in the file
       'name'.  valid_write() in the master object determines whether this  is
       allowed.   The  optional  second argument is a bitfield: If bit 0 is 1,
       then variables that  are  zero  (0)  are  also  saved  (normally,  they
       aren't).   Object  variables always save as 0.  If bit 1 is 1, then the
       save file will be compressed.


[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       save_object() returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.
