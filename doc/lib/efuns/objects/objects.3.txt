       objects - return an array of all loaded objects


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       object  *objects(  string  func, object ob ); object *objects( function
       f);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       An array of every object loaded on the mud is  returned  by  objects().
       Note  that if the system's maximum array size is set too low, objects()
       will truncate its array, in which case it might not be too useful.

       If the optional 'func' and 'ob' parameters are given,  then  ob->func()
       is  called  with  each  loaded  object as an argument.  If the function
       returns nonzero, then that object is returned by  objects(),  otherwise
       it isn't.

       If  'f'  is  given, it will be called on all the objects as above.  For
       example, objects( (: clonep :) ) returns a list of all  the  clones  in
       existence.
