[1mNAME[0m
       map_delete()  -  remove a (key, value) pair from a mapping based on the
       key


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       void map_delete( mapping m, mixed element );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       map_delete removes the (key, value) from the mapping  m  that  has  key
       equal to element.

       For example, given:

              mapping names;

              names = ([]);
              names["truilkan"] = "john";
              names["wayfarer"] = "erik";
              names["jacques"] = "dwayne";

       Then:

              map_delete(names,"truilkan");

       causes the mapping 'names' to be equal to:

              (["wayfarer" : "erik", "jacques" : "dwayne"])

       keys(names)  will  not  contain "truilkan" after map_delete(names,"tru‚Äê
       ilkan") is called [unless ("truilkan", *) is subsequently added back to
       the mapping].
