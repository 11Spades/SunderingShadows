[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       match_path()  searches a mapping for a path.  Each key is assumed to be
       a string.  The value is  completely  arbitrary.   The  efun  finds  the
       largest matching path in the mapping.  Keys ended in '/' are assumed to
       match paths with character that follow the '/', i.e. /  is  a  wildcard
       for anything below this directory.
