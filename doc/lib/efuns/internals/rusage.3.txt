[1mNAME[0m
       rusage() - reports information gathered by the getrusage() system call


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       mapping rusage( void );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  efun  collects  information  gathered  via the getrusage() system
       call.  Read the getrusage() man  page  for  more  information  on  what
       information   will   be  collected.   Some  systems  do  not  have  the
       getrusage() system call but do have the times() system call.  On  those
       systems,  only  "utime"  and  "stime"  will  be  available.   Times are
       reported in milliseconds.

       Here is an example usage of rusage():

         void
         create()
         {
             mapping info;

             info = rusage();
             write("user time = " + info["utime"] + "ms\n");
             write("system time = " + info["stime"] + "ms\n");
         }

       The available fields are:

              utime, stime,  maxrss,  ixrss,  idrss,  isrss,  minflt,  majflt,
              nswap,   inblock,  oublock,  msgsnd,  msgrcv,  nsignals,  nvcsw,
              nivcsw.
