       void swap( object );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  efun  should be reserved for debugging only.  It allows an object
       to be explicitly swapped out.  If enabled, it is  strongly  recommended
       that a simul_efun override (for this efun) be used to prevent abuse.

       Note:  objects which have been destructed, already swapped out, contain
       a heart beat, cloned, inherited, or interactive, cannot be swapped out.
