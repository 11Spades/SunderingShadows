[1mNAME[0m
       socket_connect() - initiate a connection on a socket


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       #include <socket_err.h>

       int socket_connect( int s, string address,
                           string read_callback,
                           string write_callback );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  argument  s  is  a socket. s must be either a STREAM mode or a MUD
       mode socket. address is the address to which the socket will attempt to
       connect.  address is of the form: "127.0.0.1 23"

       The  argument read_callback is the name of a function for the driver to
       call when the socket gets data from its peer. The read callback  should
       follow this format:

              void read_callback(int fd, mixed message)

       Where fd is the socket which received the data, and message is the data
       which was received.

       The argument write_callback is the name of a function for the driver to
       call  when  the  socket  is  ready to be written to. The write callback
       should follow this format:

              void write_callback(int fd)

       Where fd is the socket which is ready to be written to.
