[1mNAME[0m
       function_profile() - get function profiling information for an object


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       mixed *function_profile( object ob );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Returns  function  profiling  information for 'ob', or this_object() if
       'ob' is not specified.  This is only available if the driver  was  com‚Äê
       piled with PROFILE_FUNCTIONS defined.


[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       An  array  of  mappings is returned, one for each function in 'ob', the
       format of the mapping is:
              ([ "name"     : name_of_the_function,
                 "calls"    : number_of_calls,

                 /* cpu time expressed in microseconds */
                 "self"     : cpu_time_spent_in self,
                 "children" : cpu_time_spent_in_children
              ])
       The usefulness of this is tied to the resolution of the CPU clock--even
       though  the  units  are microseconds, the CPU timer resolution is often
       much less
