       reclaim_objects - reclaim any lingering objets


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int reclaim_objects( void );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Cycles  through  all  objects  that are loaded, and frees any lingering
       objects that it can.  This could result in a sizable amount  of  memory
       being  freed  up, depending on how the mud is coded.  Objects are typi‚Äê
       cally left lingering when a global variable in  more  than  one  object
       contains  a  pointer  to it, and the object gets destructed.  This efun
       returns the number of destructed objects encountered in variables.
