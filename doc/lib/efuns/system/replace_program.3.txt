       replace_program() - replaces the program in this_object()


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       void replace_program( string str );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       replace_program() replaces the program in this_object() with that of an
       object it inherits.  The string argument is the filename of the  object
       whose  program  is  to  be used.  Once the replacement takes place, the
       current object effectively becomes a clone of that  other  object,  but
       with  its  current  filename and global variable values. The program is
       not actually replaced until the current execution is completed.
