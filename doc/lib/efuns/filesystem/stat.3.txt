stat(3)                      LPC Library Functions                     stat(3)



[1mNAME[0m
       stat() - returns information pertaining to a file or a directory


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       mixed stat( string str, int default: 0 );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       If  str  is  the  name of a regular file (not a directory), then stat()
       will return an array of information pertaining to that file.  The  form
       of the array is as follows:

                 ({ file_size, last_time_file_touched, time_object_loaded })

       If stat is called on a directory (not a regular file), or with a second
       argument of -1, then stat() behaves identically to get_dir(3).

       get_dir(3), file_size(3)
