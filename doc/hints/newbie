You have access to a newbie line, as well as the inform line and your class lines.  These are to ask for OOC help.  They are not chat lines or for in character communication.
OOC means "out of character" - you speaking as yourself in front of the computer.  IC means "in character" - your character speaking.  Keep them seperate.
This is a PK (player killing) MUD.  You are relatively safe in the newbie area from high level players, but other newbies and monsters can kill and steal from you.  Be careful.
If you leave the newbie area, even at level 1, you can be killed by a player of any level.  Only newbies can attack you in the newbie area.
The monsters in the newbie area *can* kill you.  Be prepared.
There is a <heal> command that allows you to heal yourself without using money.  It is best for newbies and small wounds.
The world is a big place.  We suggest you pull out a piece of paper and map where you are going.  It is easy to get lost.
If you die, you can go back for your equipment, but you are not guarunteed to get it back.  If someone takes it, that is legal.  
The MUD saves your location and your equipment (except food and drink) when you quit.  Make sure and quit in a safe place.

To climb or descend, you need climbing tools or you need to have the climbing thief skills.  
To light a lantern or torch, type light lantern or light torch.  To put them out, you can "extinguish" the torch/lamp.
You need to eat and drink, you will starve after a certain period if you do not.
Your character has a stamina level.  If the stamina is used up, you will go unconscious.  You can check your condition with the <score> command.  Walking quickly without rests and battling enemies wears out your stamina.
You get extra stamina points in battle, but these points go away when the battle is over.  You can pass out if you are too tired when the adrenaline wears off.
There is no way to get back stamina except resting in one place and not fighting.
Make sure and look at all monsters and room descriptions you come into contact with.  These often contain important information.
The MUD has a number of banks.  These banks are *not* connected.  Make sure and deposit money in them for use in the case you die or are stolen from.
Only users that are staff members can show up as "Someone" on lines.  Any hidden player can show up as Someone when talking to you in the room.
Items that you are wielding or wearing can not be stolen.  Your money can be stolen at anytime, if it is not in a bank.
Unless a staff member gives you information, you should regard it as suspect unless you can confirm it in some way.

You can easily get lost!  Make sure and map where you are going and where you have been.
The gibberish you might see some people speaking is them talking in a different language.  Check 'help languages' for details on this.
The MUD will let you attack monsters that can easily kill you!  Be careful whenever you attack something you haven't fought before.
Certain types of attacks will not let you leave the room after you use them!  Thieves and fighters have some of these.  Be careful!
